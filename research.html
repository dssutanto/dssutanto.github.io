                                We calculate the engine efficiency of a Leidenfrost droplet transport
                                system to assess application for various industrial processes. The engine relies on the
                                Leidenfrost effect to transport water droplets in a straight line across a superheated
                                aluminium surface with ratchet-like topography. The engine efficiency of such a system
                                has
                                not been calculated in the literature thus far. Acceleration-time data was collected
                                using
                                Logger Pro 3® motion-tracking software and mechanical work was calculated using a
                                midpoint
                                Riemann sum. A power meter measured total power input at a constant rate. Average trial
                                times were used to determine the power input for each trial, and engine efficiencies
                                were
                                subsequently calculated. Droplet volume and ratchet angle were varied as parameters in
                                attempt to optimize engine efficiency. Our results give an extremely low average percent
                                efficiency (2.86E-07%), which agrees with previously reported results for an analogous
                                turbine system, to an order of magnitude. Varying the ratchet angle does not affect
                                engine
                                efficiency to any statistically meaningful extent. Increasing droplet volume in the
                                15-35 µL
                                range tends to marginally improve engine efficiency for steep ratchet angles.

                                The aim of the present experiment was to study the transmission of sound
                                through a building by means of replicating a small-scale model of a floor and ceiling
                                apparatus. Therefore, the relationship between input sine wave frequency and sound
                                intensity
                                through a closed apparatus was analyzed. The sound absorbance of various sound
                                insulating
                                materials was compared, and resonance properties of the apparatus was also considered.
                                Sound
                                intensity trends were investigated for frequencies within the human hearing range (up to
                                the
                                order of magnitude of 10,000 Hz), and different soundproofing material types (porous
                                absorbers and resonators) were compared. It appears that the input sound wavelength
                                (relative to the container size), as well as sound absorption coefficient were both
                                major
                                factors in transmitted sound’s intensity. Porous absorbers were found to be the most
                                robust
                                material type at both resonance and non-resonance modes, and the optimal soundproofing
                                material was the stone wool insulator (Material 2).

                                Despite distribution of millions of free mosquito nets in Angola, malaria
                                remains the primary cause of mortality in young children, accounting for 35% of deaths
                                among
                                children under five (CU5). Our objectives were first to examine the association between
                                malaria knowledge and bednet use for CU5, and second, to investigate the impact of
                                multivariable logistic regression to analyze responses from a representative sample of
                                women
                                aged 15–49 from the Angola Malaria Indicator Survey (2011). Approximately 44% of
                                respondents
                                with CU5 (n=6,576) owned at least one bednet for sleeping, and of those 87.4% identified
                                mosquitos as a cause of malaria. Adjusting for respondents’ age, region, and education,
                                those reporting mosquitos as a cause of malaria had 1.7 (95%CI: 1.3–2.2) times the odds
                                of
                                bednet use for CU5 compared to those not reporting mosquitos as a malaria cause.
                                Exposure to
                                behaviour change communication (i.e. malaria messaging) increased the odds of bednet use
                                where messaging encouraged sleeping under mosquito nets (OR: 1.3, 95%CI: 0.9–1.7). This
                                study provides evidence of a positive association between malaria knowledge and bednet
                                use,
                                indicating that along with widescale distribution of bednets for malaria prevention,
                                public
                                health efforts in Angola should focus on increasing awareness and promoting bednet usage
                                through targeted risk communication.

                                Clozapine is a crucial antipsychotic medication to treat schizophrenia
                                and has shown valuable benefits in doing so. However, there can be rare, but potentially
                                fatal adverse drug reactions to the medication. Therefore, it is essential that there is
                                careful monitoring of the patient while on the medication. A retrospective study was
                                conducted to examine the effects of clozapine on vitals during the first 2 days of
                                initiation. There were 43 (29 male, 16 female) charts analyzed retrospectively, and the
                                average age of the patients was 45 years old. The average dose of clozapine on the first
                                day
                                was 9.3mg and 15.7mg on the second day. Regarding vitals, the temperature peaked 5 hours
                                after administrating clozapine on day 1 and day 2. Furthermore, the respiration rate
                                peaked
                                4 hours post-dose on the second day and the heart rate increased the most on the second
                                day
                                indicating a dose-related response. There was no trend in blood pressure changes that
                                can be
                                inferred from the data; however, individual variations in blood pressure fluctuated
                                considerably. The study was limited due to a lack of data in patient charts, and it may
                                be
                                of interest to do a prospective study to gain more insight.

                            The effects of different temperatures on Acheta domesticus speeds, based
                                on metabolic changes, were determined to discover the biological implications on their
                                survival during natural temperature fluctuations. As a result, the effects of both short
                                term and long term climate change on the physical performance of house crickets can be
                                assessed. Two separate treatment trials were conducted with hot and cold baths to attain
                                three arenas of 20°C, 30°C and room temperature (22°C and 24°C). 10 replicates were placed
                                into each arena and the average speeds of the crickets (cm/s) were found through tracing and
                                timing. The crickets from Trial 1 had a larger mean speed difference and decreasing speeds
                                with increasing temperatures, whereas the Trial 2 crickets had increasing speeds with
                                increasing temperatures and a smaller difference in means. In both trials, the treatments
                                resulted in sufficiently different speeds; however, the results were not statistically
                                significant which indicates the null hypothesis, that states there is no difference between
                                cricket speeds due to varying temperatures, cannot be rejected. Younger crickets in Trial 1
                                were more affected by temperature fluctuations and had speeds negatively correlated with
                                temperature, whereas the older crickets in Trial 2 were less affected by temperature
                                fluctuations but had speeds positively correlated with temperature. This suggests that
                                younger crickets are less likely to survive in their natural habitats when temperatures
                                slightly increase, while older crickets are more likely to survive when temperatures change;
                                however, no definite conclusions can be made due to the experiment’s statistical
                                insignificance.

                            Water will always remain a valuable commodity due to its unique
                                properties and availability. Therefore, its transport in pipes has great significance.
                                Further, if leakage is controlled, an efficient mechanism of fluid administration can be
                                created, as seen in common drip irrigation techniques. This study changed two variables of
                                pipe perforation: hole area and pipe incline, and measured the resulting leakage rates. The
                                experimental setup consisted of a pipe of varying hole areas attached to a water reservoir
                                at varying angles. We hypothesized that for a horizontally configured pipe with a single
                                hole, the leakage rate would increase linearly with hole area. The experimental data shows
                                consistency with the hypothesis for a certain range of hole sizes but deviates from
                                linearity outside this range. The study also presents a novel equation that models the
                                correlation between pipe incline and leakage rate. The findings of this study provide more
                                knowledge to incorporate variations to the drip-irrigation technique on both flat and
                                oblique land.

                                to the highly adaptive nature of this bacterial family. Currently, CRE is resistant to
                                almost all antibiotics available (Chen, Todd, Kiehlbauch, Walters, &amp; Kallen, 2016) with
                                mortality rates of about 45% (“Vital Signs”, 2013). To better evaluate the severity of CRE
                                outbreaks in Canada and the United States (US), a Python program that analyzes and predicts
                                the potential of outbreaks escalating into epidemics was developed. The program uses two
                                mathematical models that compare and graph the relative amounts of individuals/patients that
                                are susceptible, infected or dead. The first model is deterministic which involves static
                                rates taken from various data sources, whereas the second model is stochastic, which
                                reflects dynamic rates according to parameters like time and changes in infectivity rate.
                                Both models predicted epidemics in Canada and the US under current conditions, as
                                expected

                            The present experiment aims to recreate and analyze known behavior of
                                high-voltage gaps in a near vacuum with low-cost equipment. It has been previously observed
                                that the application of high voltages in rarified gas results in electrical breakdown and
                                corona discharge, characterized by the production of observable plasma in the experimental
                                area. The current study aims to identify and document a do-it-yourself (DIY) method for
                                producing and containing electrical discharge. Further, the requirements of electrical
                                phenomena were recorded in terms of voltage and pressure to be compared to previous models,
                                namely Paschen’s Law, as a measure of accuracy (Berzak et al., 2006). The operating
                                experimental apparatus was demonstrated to exhibit the same discharge phenomena as
                                previously recorded (Peek, 1929). New models for voltage and pressure requirements for
                                electrical breakdown and corona discharge were produced. Literature comparison was available
                                for the voltage model of electrical breakdown, where significant difference was identified
                                between Paschen’s model and current data. The present study may contribute further evidence
                                to the inadequacy of Paschen’s law in describing breakdown voltages at high
                                pressure-distance configurations.

                            Visually driven and braille driven reading share common language
                                attributes, yet the skills, cognitive load, and sensory system processing required to
                                perform either task are dramatically different. Despite the significant differences in the
                                processes of braille and print reading, traditional approaches to developing braille
                                literacy have primarily relied upon adaptations of approaches used to establish sighted
                                literacy. Furthermore, little research has investigated the effectiveness of these
                                strategies for students who read braille. The outcomes, however, are clear; braille readers
                                struggle to develop effective decoding and fluency skills. One promising literacy program,
                                called the Wilson Reading System (WRS), has been adapted for braille literacy development
                                because it emphasizes fluency and comprehension. Recent research suggests positive
                                qualitative outcomes using the WRS for students with visual impairments. However, no
                                quantitative changes in braille decoding and fluency using the WRS have been established.
                                This case study extends previous findings to assess the effectiveness of the WRS on decoding
                                ability, comprehension, oral fluency rate, and reading motivation in a braille-reading
                                student with a language-based learning disability. Results demonstrate an increase in
                                decoding ability, comprehension, reading motivation, but no sign of improvement in oral
                                reading fluency.

                            We present the design for a high resolution triple-grating Czerny-Turner
                                spectrometer for visible and telecom wavelengths, together with results of optical
                                simulations using ZEMAX. Results from the simulations show that one of the most important
                                factors affecting spectral resolution is the focal length of mirrors. Increasing the focal
                                length allows for a greater degree of spatial dispersion of light diffracted from the
                                gratings and also reduces optical aberrations. Radiation of wavelengths around 1550 nm are
                                shown to have very noticeable aberrations in certain designs, evident by a large degree of
                                smudging. Using parabolic mirrors instead of spherical mirrors is demonstrated to have a
                                negligible effect when compared with increasing focal length. The optical simulations and
                                preliminary testing of mechanical components show that it is possible to build a cost
                                effective high resolution Czerny-Turner spectrometer using off the shelf components.

                            In processing audio, it can be helpful to have algorithms that can
                                extract volume and loudness information. One application of this would be find-ing speech in
                                long intervals of silence. Digital au-dio files, which contain raw information, may not
                                represent how a human can perceive the sound. For example, high and low frequencies of sound
                                with equal intensities will be perceived as having different levels of loudness. This paper
                                presents a series of processing operations to be performed on sound signals, which attempt
                                to find the loudness of sounds as perceived by a human. Previously used methods of
                                calculating perceived loudness includes looking at the frequency spectrum of sounds [1]. The
                                first operation accounts for the human percep-tion of loudness at different frequencies. The
                                sec-ond creates an envelope of the sound signal, while preventing impulses from getting
                                filtered out. These impulses are short bursts of sound such as a gun-shot or a handclap. The
                                third operation accounts for the human perception of impulse loudness. The output of this
                                process is an envelope of the original sound signal, which represents how a human would
                                perceive the audio volume. This removes the sinu-soidal components in the sound signal and
                                main-tains the sound amplitude information, with some other minor adjustments.
