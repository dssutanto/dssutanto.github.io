			<h2>Abstract</h2>

			<p>
				The objective of this study was to determine the economic factors and characteristics of universal
				healthcare development among Brazil, Russia, India and China (BRIC). A policy review was used to achieve
				this objective. This review established a comparative criterion of the key factors and characteristics
				of universal healthcare coverage development. Further, a comparison of three countries with established
				universal healthcare coverage, comprising of tax-based and social insurance models, was undertaken
				against BRIC healthcare systems. The decided upon factors and characteristics of developing and BRIC
				countries were used to inform and understand the development of process of universal healthcare
				coverage. The analysis found that continual economic growth and investment into the healthcare coverage
				are essential to successful universal healthcare coverage implementation and expansion. Understanding
				the models of healthcare systems along with the key economic factors and characteristics provides
				important context and understanding into the processes and mechanisms that drive successful universal
				healthcare coverage in developing countries. The factors and characteristics presented in this study
				provide a preliminary framework for understanding the conditions that contribute to universal healthcare
				coverage. This framework can be used as a template for a critical comparison and analysis that can be
				applied to all high, middle- and low-income countries in their effort to establish universal healthcare
				coverage.

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>A current movement in global policy has been the push towards establishing universal healthcare coverage
				(Tediosi, Finch, Procacci, Marten &amp; Missoni, 2016). This agenda was emphasized during the
				development of the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals in goal 3.8 “Achieving Universal
				Healthcare Coverage” (Tediosi et al., 2016). In 2001, British economist Jim O’Neill coined the term
				‘BRIC’ (Brazil, India, Russia and China) claiming these countries as the next economic superpowers. In
				1990, these countries represented 5.8% of the world economy. In 2015, that increased to 25.6%, and was
				projected to be between 25.6% and 40% of the world economy over the subsequent two decades (Siddiqui,
				2016). These countries represent 21.6% of the world’s population, roughly 3 billion people (Tediosi et
				al., 2016). Recent economic growth has provided the opportunity for these countries to provide universal
				healthcare coverage (Wang, 2015).</p>
			<p>Universal healthcare coverage has two main objectives: to provide everyone with the healthcare they need
				and protect people from catastrophic healthcare expenditure. Countries with universal healthcare
				coverage consistently have better population health, with the highest effects seen amongst the most
				impoverished populations (Moreno-Serra &amp; Smith, 2012). However, there are many ways to design,
				finance and implement universal healthcare coverage.</p>
			<p>Various economic factors are essential in the development and sustainability of universal healthcare
				systems (Borgonovi &amp; Compagni, 2013). This study aims to identify economic factors and
				characteristics that contribute to universal healthcare development among emerging economies, especially
				understanding how these factors influence the two goals of universal healthcare coverage: access to
				necessary healthcare and financial protection from catastrophic healthcare spending.</p>
			<p>All four BRIC countries have made political commitments towards universal healthcare coverage (Marten et
				al., 2014). However, the results of universal healthcare coverage expansion in BRIC countries varies. An
				analysis of the economic factors and characteristics is required to better identify and understand
				factors that enable and hinder universal healthcare development in BRIC countries. In addition, three
				countries were selected to be mapped against the BRIC countries; Canada, Germany, and the United
				Kingdom. These countries provide a baseline and standard of measurement for analysing and comparing the
				healthcare systems of BRIC countries. These four countries are examples of how the national and social
				insurance models can be used to finance universal healthcare coverage. The purpose of the analysis is to
				understand how the economic factors and characteristics of BRIC countries contribute to the goals of
				universal healthcare coverage.</p>

			<h2>Review</h2>

			<h3>Universal healthcare coverage</h3>
			<p>
				The World Health Organization (WHO) defines universal healthcare as the meaning “that all people and
				communities can use the promotive, preventive, curative, rehabilitative and palliative health services
				they need, of sufficient quality to be effective, while also ensuring that the use of these services
				does not expose the user to financial hardship” (World Health Organization, 2010). The motivation behind
				universal healthcare coverage is to provide everyone with access to necessary healthcare services and
				offer protection from catastrophic financial healthcare expenditure. Effective universal healthcare
				coverage contributes to the development process by reducing disease burdens and offering financial
				protection from health-related events (Frenk &amp; de Ferranti, 2012). Typically, assessment and
				measurement of universal healthcare systems are primarily concerned with the economic costs (Borgonovi
				&amp; Compagni, 2013). Economic factors inform the processes involved in creating sustainable, effective
				universal healthcare coverage (Borgonovi &amp; Compagni, 2013).
			</p>
			<h3>Models of healthcare systems</h3>
			<p>A ‘healthcare system’ is comprised of service delivery, financing and economic policy. The combination of
				these mechanisms and policies lead to healthcare access and can be built upon to achieve universal
				healthcare coverage (Kulesher &amp; Forrestal, 2014). Historically, two broad models of healthcare
				systems financing are typically used to provide publicly universal healthcare coverage: the national
				health model and the social insurance model (Kulesher &amp; Forrestal, 2014).</p>
			<p>The national health insurance model provides healthcare coverage for all citizens through the central
				government (Kulesher &amp; Forrestal, 2014) . Typically, central governments create policies and
				regulations and care is delivered through local and regional governments (Hejduková &amp; Kureková,
				2016). National insurance models are primarily financed through tax revenue that is collected and
				pooled, then allocated to local and regional governments.</p>
			<p>The second type of healthcare system is the social insurance model (Bloom, Khoury, &amp; Subbaraman,
				2018). The social insurance model covers citizens under mandatory or compulsory health insurance. These
				insurance plans are financed through an employee and employer tax or contribution. Individuals may have
				a mandated insurance plan based on their occupation, or the option to select an insurance plan based on
				their preferences (Kulesher &amp; Forrestal, 2014). Unlike the national health insurance model,
				insurance funds are managed independently (Hejduková &amp; Kureková, 2016).</p>
			<p>The third type of healthcare system financing is private healthcare spending. This can be in the form of
				private healthcare insurance offered by a company or paying for healthcare directly out-of-pocket (OOP).
				Typically, this is reserved for services outside of the scope of public healthcare and is rarely used as
				a primary driver of universal healthcare coverage. However, supplementary and complimentary private
				insurance are commonly found among publicly funded healthcare systems.</p>
			<p>Universal healthcare coverage can be achieved using these models individually or in combination. National
				health insurance typically covers citizens by entitling citizens with the right to healthcare coverage
				while the social insurance model requires citizens to select a compulsory insurance plan delivered
				through non-governmental actors. Universal coverage is achieved by governments ensuring that all people
				are entitled to healthcare insurance.</p>
			<p>Canada, Germany, and The United Kingdom are examples of how these models can be used to achieve universal
				healthcare coverage. Canada primarily uses the national insurance model, Germany primarily uses the
				social insurance model, while the United Kingdom uses a combination of both. All three countries have
				some level of private and out-of-pocket expenditure.</p>
			<h3>Economic considerations</h3>
			<p>Sufficient economic growth and resources are prerequisites to universal healthcare coverage (Russo,
				Bloom, &amp; McCoy, 2017; Wang, 2015). Sufficient economic growth must be accompanied by a rise in
				healthcare expenditure (Hall &amp; Jones, 2007). This means that a country should increase healthcare
				expenditure as its economic growth increases. A standard measure of economic growth is the Gross
				Domestic Product (GDP). A particular measure of healthcare expenditure is the proportion of GDP spent on
				healthcare. The proportion of GDP spent on healthcare measures the strength of the country’s economy and
				how much a country spends on healthcare relative to other goods and services (OECD, 2017). There is no
				exact measure for how much GDP a country should spend on healthcare. However, the WHO noted: “It is
				difficult to get close to universal coverage at less than 5% of GDP”. In 2017, the OECD average of
				healthcare expenditure as a proportion of GDP was 9.0% (OECD, 2017). These two measures provide a
				baseline for assessment when comparing BRIC countries.</p>
			<p>A key economic characteristic that measures financial protection is the percentage of healthcare coverage
				that is financed publicly. Public expenditure on healthcare demonstrates a government’s level of
				commitment to providing universal healthcare coverage, as well as the progress that each country has
				made in achieving financial protection by increasing share of public health expenditure over
				out-of-pocket (World Health Organization, 2017). This is measured by the percentage of public healthcare
				expenditure. Another economic measure used to assess universal healthcare coverage is health expenditure
				per capita. Healthcare expenditure per capita provides insight into the resources a country has devoted
				to healthcare and how spending has changed in context to social and economic factors. It also provides
				insight into the financing mechanism and the organizational structure of a healthcare system (OECD,
				2017).</p>
			<p>While there are no exact measures for per capita spending, the WHO found that improvements in healthcare
				service coverage occurred when countries spent $40 to $80 per capita on healthcare. However, to achieve
				both health and financial protection, public expenditure needed to be greater than $200 per capita
				(World Health Organization, 2010). Among OECD countries, the average health expenditure per capita was
				$4003.00 in 2016 (OECD, 2017). The WHO’s $200.00 per capita will be used to determine if countries are
				spending enough to provide adequate health and financial protection. While the OECD average of $4000 per
				capita will be used to compare BRIC countries against developed countries with high achieving universal
				healthcare coverage.</p>
			<p>Lastly, two measures of out-of-pocket expenditure are used to determine catastrophic health expenditure;
				out-of-pocket spending exceeding 10% and 25% of household income. Spending 15-20% or more of an
				individual or family’s annual income on healthcare has been shown to significantly increase the chances
				of impoverishment from healthcare costs (World Health Organization, 2017). These measures are important
				to understanding if universal healthcare coverage is achieving its goal of protecting people from
				catastrophic healthcare expenditure.</p>
			<h3>BRIC healthcare systems: Brazil</h3>
			<p>Brazil’s healthcare system is both funded and delivered publicly and privately (Kulesher &amp; Forrestal,
				2014). In 1998 Brazil develop the Unified Health System (UHS), offering free care at the point of
				delivery. The UHS covers 75% of the population (Jakovljevic, 2014).</p>
			<p>The UHS is financed and delivered on the national, provincial and municipal levels, most closely
				resembling the National Health Insurance Model. Funding is designated from a value-added tax and social
				security contributions (Reich et al., 2016). From 2000 to 2014, Brazil increased healthcare spending
				from 7.0% to 8.3% of GDP, along with an increase in per capita spending on healthcare from $263 to $947
				(Massuda, Hone, Leles, Castro, &amp; Atun, 2018). The distribution of Brazil’s healthcare spending is
				split between the public and private sector. Free, government funded healthcare is offered to the
				population, but this only accounts for 46.0% of all healthcare spending. While the private sector, which
				primarily consists of people paying out-of-pocket for healthcare services, comprises 54% of all
				healthcare spending (Massuda et al., 2018). Out-of-pocket spending is still high in Brazil, with 25.6%
				of the population still spending 10% of their income and 3.46% spending more than 25% of their income on
				healthcare (World Health Organization, 2017).</p>
			<h3>BRIC healthcare systems: Russia</h3>
			<p>The Russian healthcare system does not use a National or Social Insurance model. Instead, the healthcare
				system is delivered through the Semashko model of healthcare. The model is an entirely universal system,
				entitling all citizens to free healthcare. The main characteristics of this model are publicly funded
				medical facilities, salaried healthcare workers, and high amounts of government administration (Sheiman,
				Shishkin, &amp; Shevsky, 2018).</p>
			<p>Currently, Russia contributes 3.5% of its GDP to healthcare, spending $1474 per capita on healthcare.
				Further, 61% of healthcare expenditure was public (OECD, 2017). Russia does the best job of financial
				protection among BRIC countries, with 4.9% of the population spending 10%, and 0.60% of the population
				spending 25% or more of their income on out-of-pocket health expenditure (World Health Organization,
				2017).</p>
			<h3>BRIC healthcare systems: India</h3>
			<p>In 1983, India mandated “health for all” through the establishment of the National Health Policy (NHP)
				(Agarwal &amp; Tofighi, 2016). India’s healthcare system covers people through three streams; Rashtriya
				Swasthya Bima Yojana for people who fall below the poverty line, the Employee State Insurance for
				factory workers, and Scheme and the Central Government Health Scheme for civil servants (Mossialos,
				2017). Through these three schemes, healthcare coverage extended to approximately 20% of the population.
				India’s healthcare system is predominately financed through taxes on the national, state and provincial
				level (Mossialos, 2017).</p>
			<p>In 2015, the World Bank reported that India spent 3.9% of its GDP on healthcare, a decrease from 4.0%
				spent in 2000 (World Bank, 2018). In 2015, India spent $238 per capita on healthcare.17.3% of people
				spend 10% of their income, and 3.9% of people spend 25% or more on health expenditure (World Health
				Organization, 2017).</p>
			<h3>BRIC healthcare systems: China</h3>
			<p>In 2005 less than 50% of the Chinese population was covered by some form of health insurance. By 2011,
				95% of Chinese citizens had access to public healthcare, marking the largest expansion of health
				insurance coverage in human history (Yu, 2015). The central government is responsible for health
				legislation, policy, and administration. Every citizen is entitled to receive a basic, pre-set package
				of healthcare services (Mossialos, 2017).</p>
			<p>China’s healthcare system is comprised of three public insurance schemes; New Rural Co-Operative Medical
				Scheme, Urban Resident Basic Medical Scheme, and Urban Employee Basic Medical Insurance (Yu, 2015). All
				citizens are required to put forth $30 to $50 annually to subsidize public health insurance (Yip et al.,
				2012).</p>
			<p>WHO reports that China has increased healthcare spending from 2000 to 2016 form 4.49% to 5.32% of GDP
				(World Bank, 2019) and spends $761 per person on healthcare (World 2019). In 2014, 38% of China’s
				healthcare system was financed publicly (Mossialos, 2017). Out-of-pocket spending is still high in
				China, with 17.3% of people spending 10% of their income, and 4.8% of their population spend 25% or more
				on healthcare services (World Health Organization, 2017).</p>
			<h3>Analysis</h3>
			<p>Recent economic development has poised BRIC countries to develop and expand universal healthcare coverage
				(Rao, Petrosyan, Araujo, &amp; McIntyre, 2014). All four countries exceed the WHO’s $40 to $80 per
				capita to achieve adequate health protection and the $200 per capita mark set for health and financial
				protection. However, BRIC nations lag per capita healthcare expenditure when compared to the listed
				developed countries and the OECD average, as all BRIC fall far below the OECD average of $4003.00 per
				capita. Russia, China, and Brazil spend around 20% of the OECD average, while India spent less than 10%
				(OECD, 2017). When comparing this measure against the lowest of the listed developed countries; the
				United Kingdom ($4245.50), BRIC countries are still far behind. The proportion of GDP spent on
				healthcare is a way to measure of a countries commitment to providing public healthcare services. Brazil
				stands out, spending 8.3% of their GDP on healthcare, relatively close to the 9.0% of OECD average, but
				still far behind Canada, Germany which spend close to or more than 10% of their GDP on healthcare.</p>
			<p>To examine financial protection, it is important to examine the proportion of healthcare expenditure
				coming from of out-of-pocket. With the exception of Russia; BRIC Countries have a considerably higher
				proportions their populations who spend 10% of their income on healthcare services when compared against
				countries who predominately provide universal healthcare coverage through the National and Social Health
				Insurance models such as Canada, Germany, and the United Kingdom. Further, Canada, Germany, and the
				United Kingdom all have less than 1% of their population paying more than 25% of their income on
				healthcare. In Brazil, China, and India range from 3.5 to 4.8% of their population paying more than 25%
				of their income on healthcare.</p>
			<p>These numbers are highly suggestive of the progress that needs to be made in Brazil, China, and India to
				protect people from catastrophic healthcare expenditure. These numbers can be more informative when
				analysed in the context of the proportion of healthcare spending that is publicly financed. In Brazil,
				Russia, India, and China, less than 50% of the healthcare GDP expenditure is publicly financed. In
				Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, the public GDP expenditure ranges from 69.8% to 78%. This
				suggests the possibility of a strong relationship between public financing and a reduction in
				catastrophic healthcare expenditure. This relationship is further supported by research suggesting that
				financial protection does not increase directly with a rise in the proportion of GDP spent on
				healthcare. Rather, financial protection is more strongly associated through the pathways of healthcare
				spending (Wagstaff et al., 2018). This finding along with the low proportion of catastrophic healthcare
				expenditure in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom strengthens the case for building universal
				healthcare coverage around the publicly funded national and social insurance models (Bloom et al.,
				2018).</p>
			<p>Each BRIC country faces a unique set of challenges in their efforts towards achieving universal
				healthcare coverage. The findings in this review suggest that BRIC countries should prioritize modelling
				their healthcare systems after publicly funded national and social insurance healthcare financing
				models. The success these models in Canada, Germany and the United Kingdom, along with the relative
				success achieved in China and Brazil, demonstrates that these models could be effectively used towards
				achieving universal healthcare coverage.</p>
			<p>The sustainability of universal healthcare systems has come into question in the developed world due to
				rising costs. It is essential that BRIC countries prioritize their budgets and focus on risk pooling to
				increase the efficiency of revenue collection. Pooling revenue is a highly effective method towards
				achieving and sustaining universal healthcare coverage. Also, pooling funds are an essential part of all
				national and social insurance models (Reich et al., 2016). Pooling funds allow finances and risk to be
				spread and shared across an entire population. This prevents catastrophic health expenditure by This
				leads to more affordable and equitable services and prevents catastrophic healthcare expenditure which
				ultimately results in improved population health (Lagomarsino, Garabrant, Adyas, Muga, &amp; Otoo, 2012;
				Moreno-Serra &amp; Smith, 2012). Pooling funds builds system capacity by creating a more unified
				healthcare system that enables a responsive healthcare system which can invest in the specific needs of
				populations. In addition to pooling funds, BRIC countries should focus on innovative ways to finance
				their healthcare systems to continue investing in their healthcare systems. For example, countries have
				added taxes to items such as sugar-sweetened beverages and tobacco (Mossialos, 2017) that are earmarked
				to raise revenue specifically for their healthcare systems. These mechanisms have been found to increase
				revenue for the healthcare systems but also encourage health promoting behaviours. Investment into
				healthcare systems needs to be continuous and persistent in order to each universal healthcare coverage.
				Healthcare systems that are not reliant on one source of funding are more likely to be sustainable and
				resilient through times economic, political and social change.</p>
			<h2>Conclusions</h2>

			<p>BRIC countries are all at different levels of universal healthcare coverage. All four countries have
				taken different approaches during implementation and coverage expansion. However, progress in all BRIC
				countries is required before universal coverage can truly be achieved. Ideally, BRIC countries should
				prioritize modelling their public healthcare systems after the national and social insurance models
				through the development of pooling financial resources and finding innovative ways to finance their
				healthcare systems.</p>
			<p>Further research and analysis to support the preliminary analysis of this review would beneficial. In
				particular, establishing statistical correlations between the selected indicators and healthcare
				coverage expansion would add legitimacy to the arguments in this paper. Also, an examination of the
				selected factors over more extended periods (longitudinal) analysed would increase the depth of this
				study. Lastly, this approach could be applied to further developing economies, such as Mexico,
				Indonesia, Nigeria and Turkey (MINT), which have been identified as growing economies undergoing reform
				towards expanding healthcare coverage.</p>
