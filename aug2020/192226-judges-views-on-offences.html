			<h2>Abstract</h2>

			<p>
				The objective of this research is to investigate Canadian criminal judges’ views on offences related to
				procuring, seeking, or controlling under-aged sex workers, and factors influencing sentence severity. A
				qualitative analysis was conducted on sentencing court reports in Canada obtained through the Canadian
				Legal Information Institute (CanLII) database. Twelve sentencing court reports that fit the criteria of
				inclusion were selected as samples. Data analysis and coding procedures were guided by theories put
				forth by Amirault and Beauregard (2014), and Kingsnorth, MacIntosh, and Wentworth (1999), in combination
				with a grounded theory approach. Results revealed that mitigating and aggravating factors, and existing
				provisions in the Criminal Code of Canada were the main factors influencing judges’ decisions on
				sentence severity. Furthermore, judges viewed these offences as inherently wrong, and attributed
				culpability entirely on the offender by referring to under-aged sex workers as vulnerable victims, and
				chastising offenders by referring to their behaviours as selfish and disgusting. Implications in
				relation to current societal views on sex-workers were discussed, and strategies for future research
				were suggested.
			</p>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>The act of selling sex is not illegal in Canada, although communication and other activities related to
				obtaining sexual services from prostitutes have been prohibited by the Criminal Code of Canada (Criminal
				Code) (Shaver, 2011). The ground-breaking judgement in Canada (Attorney General) v. Bedford SCC 72
				(2013) where the Supreme Court of Canada struck down several laws regulating activities related to
				prostitution (e.g. bans on street soliciting and brothels) illustrates our society’s changing views on
				sex workers. Prior to the Bedford case, feminist movements in the 1970’s challenged the
				constitutionality of Canada’s prostitution laws, arguing that sex workers should be viewed as victims
				and not criminals (Davies, 2015). Under this view, individuals who procure or exploit sex workers should
				be the ones criminalized (Rotenberg, 2016). Moreover, public perceptions towards sex offenders who
				target victims under 18 years old are overtly negative, and the public highly stigmatized them (Corabian
				&amp; Hogan, 2015) due to the fact that children are often viewed as a vulnerable population (Bill C-2,
				2005, “Summary”, (b)(c)). A heinous act victimizing under-aged sex workers would therefore create a
				‘double-jeopardy’ in terms of severity of the crime.</p>
			<p>Recent research has shown that the community’s attitude towards sex offenders are generally negative,
				propelled by beliefs that sex offenders are compulsive, incapable of changing their irrational
				behaviours, and socially withdrawn (Wevodau, Cramer, Gemberling, &amp; Clark III, 2016). Additionally,
				Bumby and Maddox (1999) found that the public often demanded swift and extreme punishments for sex
				offenders, increased mandatory minimum sentences, and sex offender registries (the Sex Offender
				Information Registration Act (SOIRA) in Canada). As representatives of the public, judges are expected
				to accommodate the public’s concerns and attitudes towards sex offenders, and to uphold social justice
				through sentencing. Some studies have found that the public’s opinion on the ideal length of sentences
				is similar to what has been given by judges (Devilly &amp; Le Grand, 2015). Additionally, other research
				has shown that judges have predisposed biases when it comes to sex offenders which align their opinions
				with public perceptions and would result in more punitive sentences when compared to non-sexual
				offenders (Rydberg, Cassidy, &amp; Socia, 2017).</p>
			<p>In Canada, §718.2 of the Criminal Code outlines sentencing principles, which considers mitigating and
				aggravating factors that judges would have to take into account when imposing sentences. Some studies
				have found that the main aggravating factor in influencing the length of prison sentence is prior
				criminality (Roberts, 2008). However, other studies have shown that judges consider offence-based
				characteristics (e.g. violent offences like rape or murder) as being more important than the
				characteristics of the victim or offender (Patrick &amp; Marsh, 2011). In other words, judges find the
				act of the sex offence so heinous that it is considered an aggravating factor of its own. Further,
				Kingsnorth, MacIntosh, and Wentworth (1999) found that victims’ ‘negative’ characteristics (e.g. acts of
				prostitution) contributed to lower sentence severity for sex offenders. This finding suggests that,
				although the public may assign victimized roles to sex workers, the fact that sex workers ‘choose’ such
				a line of work could still present a mitigating factor when it comes to sentencing sex purchasers.</p>
			<p>However, under-aged sex workers may be viewed differently. Literature has shown that child-sex offenders
				were sentenced more severely compared to other violent offences (Champion, 1988). In researching
				mitigating and aggravating factors on sentence severity among Canadian sex offenders, Amirault and
				Beauregard (2014) found that the victim’s age and physical violence towards the victim were strong
				aggravating factors for increased sentences. This finding is in accordance with Devilly and Le Grand’s
				(2015) research showing that the public believed imprisonment was more appropriate for sexual assault
				against children when compared to other types of offences. Although much research has been conducted in
				examining factors that contribute to the sentencing of sex offenders through quantitative analysis,
				there seems to be a gap in qualitative literature, which this study aims to fill. Thus, the research
				questions for this study are: 1) how do Canadian criminal court judges view offences related to
				procuring, seeking, or controlling under-aged sex workers?; and 2) how do they justify sentencing the
				offenders who were found guilty of the crime(s)?. Correspondingly, this exploratory study is guided by
				two theories outlined above: that 1) a victim’s age influences sentence severity (Amirault &amp;
				Beauregard, 2014), and that 2) a victim’s negative characteristics act as a mitigating factor in
				sentencing (Kingsnorth et al., 1999; Horowitz, Kerr, Park, &amp; Gockel, 2006).</p>

				<figcaption>Fig. 1: coding process conducted for the study’s data</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<h3>Materials</h3>
			<p>
				Data was extracted from published Canadian court sentencing reports at the provincial level. These court
				reports represent the unobtrusive and non-live unit of analysis. Specifically, court reports were
				retrieved from the legal database provided by the Canadian Legal Information Institute (CanLII). Twelve
				reports represented the final sample for this study.
			</p>
			<h3>Sampling procedure</h3>
			<p>
				Based on the research question of this study, the following criteria of inclusion were applied: 1)
				criminal court reports of offences involving the procuring, seeking, or controlling of sex workers, 2)
				cases with victims under the age of 18, 3) court reports from provincial courts, 4) cases of convicted
				and sentenced individuals, 5) sentence length of at least 12 months, and 6) court reports of reasons for
				sentences. For criteria five, the Criminal Code specifies that less serious offences (summary offences)
				will result in a sentence of 2 years less-a-day, whereas more serious offences (indictable offences)
				will result in sentences of at least 2 years. Thus, in order to include a wider spectrum of crime
				severity, the decision was made to include cases that were on the higher end of summary sentences
				spectrum (i.e. 1 year to 2 years less-a-day). Further, to ensure that this sample is representative of
				Canada, a stratified purposive sampling (i.e. samples within samples) was employed – cases were chosen
				from different provinces including six from Ontario, two from Nova Scotia, and one each from Manitoba,
				British Columbia, Saskatchewan, and Quebec. There were no cases from other provinces found in the CanLII
				database which satisfied the criteria of inclusion above. These cases were chosen to represent the
				sample as this will better reflect modern society’s views on the sexual exploitation of under-aged sex
				workers. The date range for this study’s data dated between 1993 and 2017.
			</p>
			<h3>Data analysis and coding</h3>
			<p>
				This study adopts both deductive and inductive methods in its analysis. In terms of deductive method,
				two theories from the literature guided the research question: that 1) a victim’s age influences
				sentence severity (Amirault &amp; Beauregard, 2014), and that 2) a victim’s negative characteristics act
				as a mitigating factor in sentencing (Kingsnorth et al., 1999; Horowitz, Kerr, Park, &amp; Gockel,
				2006). This is coupled with an inductive approach using grounded theory analysis. Grounded theory is a
				method of analysis in which the development of theory follows analysis of the data itself (Glaser &amp;
				Strauss, 1967). Once the sample has been gathered, a first read-through of all the court reports were
				conducted. Each court report was tagged numerically (e.g. Case 1, Case 2). In this first read-through,
				broad emerging themes were highlighted for descriptive coding. Next, an Excel spreadsheet was created to
				record emerging themes and subthemes. In the second read-through, categorical coding was conducted,
				where descriptive codes found earlier were grouped together into larger themes. For the third
				read-through, focussed coding was conducted, where descriptive and categorical codes were compared
				against each other, which were then developed into analytical categories. These analytical categories
				were refined to include a broader interpretation of the data, where entire sentences or paragraphs were
				included in part of the analysis. Through a grounded theory approach, five main emerging themes were
				identified, along with corresponding subthemes (Figure 1). A fourth and final read-through was conducted
				on the sample to ensure that no new themes emerged, and reflexivity was performed throughout the
				analysis process to ensure that the data was appropriately categorized.

				<figcaption>Fig. 2: judge’s reasons for sentencing; grounded theory analysis revealed five main themes
					and their associated subthemes.</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<p>
				The present study identified five main themes related to judges’ reasons and views towards sentencing
				individuals who were convicted of offences related to procuring, seeking, or controlling under-aged sex
				workers: 1) mitigating factors, 2) aggravating factors, 3) vulnerable victims, 4) negative internal
				attributes towards the offender, and 5) the Criminal Code as a tool to guide sentencing. Each main theme
				further consisted of subthemes, as outlined in Figure 2.
			</p>
			<h3>Mitigating factors</h3>
			<p>In every court sentencing report, judges weighed mitigating factors surrounding the accused in
				determining the sentence severity; these factors were usually presented by the defence in hopes of a
				lighter sentence. Within mitigating factors, three subthemes emerged: 1) mental health, 2) lack of a
				prior criminal record, and 3) the offender’s age.</p>
			<p>Mental health was a common mitigating factor that judges looked for in sentencing decisions as it decides
				the accused’s moral culpability. For example, in Case 12, the judge reiterated the defence’s arguments:
			</p>
			<span class="quote">
				[…] defence counsel also urged the court to find that Mr. Finestone’s diagnoses of Autism Spectrum
				Disorder further serves to mitigate his circumstances as it played a contributing role in the offence
				before the court. (Case 12, para. 51)</span>
			<p>
				In the above case, the judge considered the accused’s mental illness but ruled that it appeared to be
				mild (according to expert testimony), and “…that it was not the only factor causing Mr. Finestone to
				commit this offence…” (Case 12, para. 58). Moreover, judges also look to any prior criminal record and
				the offender’s age:
			</p>
			<span class="quote">
				I note Mr. Ackman’s age, that he has no past criminal record and that he has support in the community as
				significant mitigating factors. (Case 2, para. 29)</span>
			<span class="quote">
				[…] but he’s a young man and he enjoys the support of his family. There’s ample room for rehabilitation
				and that remains an important goal of sentence. (Case 7, para. 11)</span>
			<p>
				It is important to note that, although the lack of a prior criminal record and an offender’s being a
				young adult may serve as mitigating factors, judges seemed to put more weight on the seriousness of the
				offence itself, in which constitutes an aggravating factor.
			</p>
			<h3>Aggravating factors</h3>
			<p>
				Along with mitigating factors, judges also considered aggravating factors which surrounds the crime.
				This is usually put forth by the Crown in hopes of achieving the maximum penalty. In terms of
				aggravating factors, three subthemes were identified: 1) violence, control, and coercion, 2) drugs and
				alcohol, and 3) lack of remorse:
			</p>
			<span class="quote">
				Mr. Moazami used violence and the threat of violence, intimidation and coercion in relation to M.N.
				during their association between 2009 and 2011. When M.N. first began working as a prostitute for Mr.
				Moazami, he used a threat of slapping her as a means of coercing her into accepting a client that she
				had initially refused to service. (Case 1, para. 47)</span>
			<p>
				The above example echoes Amirault and Beauregard’s (2014) finding that offenders who used violence to
				control the victim during the crime were given longer and harsher sentences, compared to offenders who
				did not use violence. Furthermore, offenders were judged more harshly if they introduced or provided
				illicit substances to under-aged sex workers during the commission of the crime. Illicit substances and
				alcohol abuse have been proven throughout the decades to have contributed to impaired attention, memory,
				and executive attention in adults (Luciana, M., Collins, P., Muetzel, R., &amp; Lim, K., 2013), and the
				effects are much more detrimental to adolescents (O’ Shea, Singh, Mcgregor, &amp; Mallet, 2004; Schubart
				et al., 2011). As exemplified by the judge in Case 1:
			</p>
			<span class="quote">
				[…] he plied her with drugs and alcohol to ensure that she was physically and emotionally dependent upon
				him. (Case 1, para. 70)</span>
			<p>
				Previous research has shown that an offender’s signs of remorse (or lack thereof) can greatly influence
				the judge’s sentencing decisions. Offenders who did not provide statements of oral or written
				communications in recognition of wrongdoing were often seen as unremorseful, and were given harsher
				sentences (Zhong et al., 2014). In this current study, an offender’s choice to remain silent when given
				the opportunity to make a statement during sentence hearing, or claim that he did not know the sex
				workers were under-aged, were considered as aggravating factors:
			</p>
			<span class="quote">
				[…] he has not shown any remorse or insight to his criminal behaviour. And, he has not accepted any
				meaningful responsibility for hurting or exploiting or exposing to danger any of the girls or young
				women. (Case 2, para. 29).</span>
			<p>
				This finding is contradictory to Amirault and Beauregard’s (2014) research results, where the authors
				found that an offender’s degree of remorse had no effect on sentence severity. One possible explanation
				is that victims in the present study’s sample were marginalized women. Failure on the offender’s part to
				recognize how his actions had caused physical and psychological damage to these victims speaks to his
				moral character, thus leading to an increase in sentence severity.
			</p>
			<h3>Vulnerable victims</h3>
			<p>Another emergent theme that surfaced from judges’ reasonings during sentencing was the view that
				under-aged sex workers were vulnerable victims. Particularly, judges view the offender as 1) taking
				advantage of young girls, and 2) manipulating them into the sex-work environment.</p>
			<p>All of the offenders in this sample were adult males, and some were significantly older than their
				victims (highest range was 30 years). Judges took this into regard during sentencing, often viewing the
				offenders as “exploit[ing] underage women” (Case 4, para. 14). As one judge in Case 12 noted:</p>
			<p>I draw from this that the coercion involved related to manipulation of a vulnerable young person as
				opposed to explicit or even implied threats or violence. (Case 12, para. 37)</p>
			<p>The above excerpt showed that the under-aged sex worker was viewed as a victim, despite her role as a sex
				worker. This is contrary to Kingsnorth et al.’s (1999) finding where a victim’s negative characteristics
				led to lower sentence severity. One possibility is that the victims in this study were minors and were
				thus viewed as vulnerable; any person who takes advantage of their vulnerability and innocence should be
				highly condemned, regardless of the victim’s background.</p>
			<h3>Negative internal attribution</h3>
			<p>The fourth theme that emerged from this study was the way judges attributed the offenders’ behaviours
				internally through 1) being selfish, 2) being disgusting, and that 3) they warranted condemnation.</p>
			<p>Judges attributed the offences as acts of greed and self-centredness, “[…] a horrible display of vanity
				and self-aggrandizement” (Case 2, para. 37). Although certain mitigating factors may serve to lessen the
				severity of their sentences (e.g., no prior criminal record), judges did not hold back from verbalizing
				their perceptions of the offenders:</p>
			<span class="quote">At the end of the day, Mr. Ackman is a middle-aged man with no past criminal record, who
				for no obvious reason except money and vanity happily wallowed in the grimy underbelly of the sex-trade
				business with its oft built-in exploitation and sexual abuse. (Case 2, para. 45)</span>
			<span class="quote">Mr. Moazami’s treatment of H.W. was abusive, callous, and borders on psychopathic. She
				was his property to sell and to misuse. (Case 1, para. 112)</span>
			<span class="quote">Well informed members of our community would be shocked and disgusted by Mr. Moazami’s
				conduct. (Case 1, para. 71)</span>
			<p>
				This finding is reminiscent of Rydberg et al.’s (2017) study where they found judges tend to hold
				negative stereotypes for sex offenders mirroring the public’s attitude. Offenders who took advantage of
				under-aged sex workers, whether to procure them, seek their services, or control them were labelled
				“parasites of our society” (Case 12, para. 76) in judges’ eyes. This negative inclination against
				offenders will no doubt have an immense effect on the severity of their sentence.
			</p>
			<h3>Criminal Code as a tool</h3>
			<p>The final theme that emerged from this study was the judges’ referring to existing legislations and
				regulations (the Criminal Code) that were used as tools to establish sentencing decisions. Particularly,
				judges pointed to 1) mandatory minimum sentences, 2) deterrence and denunciation, and 3) SOIRA.</p>
			<p>In all of the reports sampled, judges made references to the mandatory minimum sentence outlined in §212
				(2.1) of the Criminal Code, which specifies that the offence of “living off the avails of child
				prostitution” mandates a minimum 5 years’ imprisonment sentence. Although judges referred to precedent
				cases to help them determine the sentence for the case at hand, existing provisions like mandatory
				minimum sentences played a larger role in the judge’s decision in order to deter and denounce such acts:
			</p>
			<span class="quote">It is clearly a sentence that reflects Parliament’s intention that certain designated
				offences be subject to a minimum sentence due to their serious nature. Further, I find that the
				sentencing provisions of the Criminal Code reflect the community’s belief that offenders should be
				required to serve at least the minimum sentence for each offence they commit against young persons.

				More than half of the reports sampled resulted in the judge ordering a SOIRA order against the offender,
				ranging from 10 years to a lifetime. Research has found that the public were generally supportive of
				swift and harsh punishments for sex offenders (Bumby &amp; Maddox, 1999; Levenson, Brannon, Fortney,
				&amp; Baker, 2007), which include mandatory minimum sentences and SOIRA. Further, according to Devilly
				and Legrand (2015), the lengths of sentences imposed by judges on sex offenders were found to be similar
				to what the public would like to have imposed as well. This relationship is evident in the current
				study, where judges agreed with the attitudes and beliefs of the public as found in previous literature
				(Levenson et al., 2007) with regards to offenders who exploit under-aged sex workers.

			<h2>Discussion</h2>

			<p>This study’s aim was to uncover and investigate Canadian criminal court judges’ views on offences related
				to procuring, seeking, or controlling under-aged sex workers, and what factors influenced judges’
				decisions on sentence severity. Through a combination of deductive and inductive analysis, five main
				themes were uncovered. In terms of judges’ views on offenders, it was found that judges made negative
				internal attributions – the offender was selfish, his behaviour was disgusting, and warranted high
				condemnation. This negative view on the offender’s personality is congruent with Rydberg et al.’s (2017)
				findings that sex offenders were usually more negatively stereotyped than non-sex offenders.
				Furthermore, the culpability for these crimes against under-aged sex workers was placed entirely on the
				offenders. There were no indications that the victims’ negative characteristics mitigated the
				seriousness of the offence, contrary to Kingsnorth et al.’s (1999) findings. In fact, judges viewed
				under-aged victims as vulnerable victims who were manipulated or taken advantage of by offenders. This
				could possibly be due to society’s changing views on sex-workers (Weitzer, 2015), under which they are
				viewed as victims, placing the blame on sex purchasers.</p>
			<p>In terms of factors that influenced judges’ decisions on sentence severity, results showed that judges
				weighed both mitigating and aggravating factors. In line with previous studies, the victim’s age and
				presence of violence were significant factors that led to an increase in sentence severity (Amirault
				&amp; Beauregard, 2014; Patrick &amp; Marsh, 2011). Contrarily, judges in the current study also weighed
				mitigating factors like the offender’s mental health and lack of previous criminal convictions when
				handing out sentences (Crawford, 2000; Frase, 2010). In addition, judges were also found to rely heavily
				on available sentencing provisions outlined in the Criminal Code by referring to mandatory minimum
				sentences, and SOIRA while emphasizing the need to impose punitive sentences to achieve deterrence and
				denunciation of such crimes.</p>
			<p>Findings from this study provides a qualitative insight into how Canadian judges view offenders who
				exploit under-aged sex workers, and to peek into the inner workings of judges’ rationality in
				determining the severity of the sentences. It is interesting that, although judges are seen as trying to
				remain impartial during sentencing, heuristics and biases against offenders do play a hand in
				justifications for sentences. This is exemplified by judges referring to offenders’ negative internal
				attributions, and how under-aged sex workers were victims in the hands of these “parasites” (Case 12,
				para. 76). Thus, the offence of exploiting under-aged sex workers is seen as mala in se (wrong or evil
				in itself). This study is not without its limitations: the coding and analysis process involved four
				read-throughs of the sample – however it was only conducted by the primary researcher. Limited resources
				and time prevented the possibility of a second coder, which could have increased its validity through
				inter-rater reliability checking. Furthermore, although 12 sentencing court reports were carefully
				selected to represent the sample, data saturation could not be achieved as the database (CanLII) did not
				contain sentencing reports from other Canadian provinces besides the six that were surveyed for this
				study. Future studies could include court reports where sentences were served in the community or were
				less than 12 months in length.</p>
			<p>Future research could examine as to how much effect personal biases and heuristics towards victims have
				in the role of sentencing. An example could include a survey administered to judges using the Community
				Attitudes Toward Sex Offenders (CATSO) scale, in which an 18-item self-report questionnaire measures the
				respondents’ attitudes towards sex offenders (Harper, &amp; Hogue, 2015; Wevodau et al., 2016). Items
				like risk perceptions, stereotype endorsement, and punitiveness within CATSO can help shed some light
				into the general attitude of the judges and compare the results to their responses concerning non-sex
				offenders. Future research could also look into whether the existing legislative tools are enough to
				justify appropriate penalties for offences against vulnerable victims. These questions can add to the
				sparse qualitative literature on sex offences.</p>
