			<h2>Abstract</h2>

			<p>
				We calculate the engine efficiency of a Leidenfrost droplet transport system to assess application for
				various industrial processes. The engine relies on the Leidenfrost effect to transport water droplets in
				a straight line across a superheated aluminium surface with ratchet-like topography. The engine
				efficiency of such a system has not been calculated in the literature thus far. Acceleration-time data
				was collected using Logger Pro 3® motion-tracking software and mechanical work was calculated using a
				midpoint Riemann sum. A power meter measured total power input at a constant rate. Average trial times
				were used to determine the power input for each trial, and engine efficiencies were subsequently
				calculated. Droplet volume and ratchet angle were varied as parameters in attempt to optimize engine
				efficiency. Our results give an extremely low average percent efficiency (2.86E-07%), which agrees with
				previously reported results for an analogous turbine system, to an order of magnitude. Varying the
				ratchet angle does not affect engine efficiency to any statistically meaningful extent. Increasing
				droplet volume in the 15-35 µL range tends to marginally improve engine efficiency for steep ratchet
				angles.

			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>All compounds have characteristic phase-change temperatures. Past the boiling point of a compound, an
				interesting phenomenon can be observed which allows the compound to maintain liquid or even solid form
				while in contact with a superheated surface (Bernardin et al., 1999; Biance et al., 2003; Cole et al.,
				2015; Hashmi et al., 2012; Lagubeau et al., 2011; Linke et al., 2006; Ok et al., 2011; Quéré, 2013;
				Walker, 1994; Wells et al., 2015). Most famously, when a liquid water droplet is placed onto a
				superheated aluminium surface (hotter than its boiling temperature) a vapour layer instantaneously forms
				underneath the droplet, insulating the liquid water and thereby preventing its rapid evaporation. Water
				vapour conducts thermal energy approximately one order of magnitude lower than liquid water (Walker,
				1994). The temperature at which the droplet exists for the longest time is called the Leidenfrost
				temperature. Near the Leidenfrost temperature, liquid water droplets can be maintained for several
				minutes (Biance et al., 2003; Lagubeau, et al., 2011; for review see Quéré, 2013).</p>
			<p>As first demonstrated by Linke et al. (2006), liquid water droplets on a superheated metal slab with
				ratchet-like topography travel in a well-defined direction with a well-defined velocity. This locomotive
				force is thought to be caused by the exiting of vapour under the droplet directed by the asymmetric
				topography of the metal surface (Lagubeau et al., 2011, Linke et al., 2006). Following the successful
				proof-of-concept study (Linke et al., 2006), many practical applications have been envisioned for the
				Leidenfrost system. The low friction environment and lack of moving parts alludes to an efficient and
				potentially advantageous mechanism for transporting liquid, dissolved solutes, or supported objects.
				Hashmi et al. (2012) showed that multiple Leidenfrost drops traveling together could be harnessed to
				transport ‘carts’ weighing up to 50 g.</p>
			<p>Cole et al. (2015) showed that it is possible to engineer the trajectory of a Leidenfrost droplet to be
				sensitive to surface temperature. This discovery opened up a wide possibility for feedback cooling
				mechanisms that do not rely on electrical or moving components. Ok et al. (2011) observed that
				ratchet-like structures can help injected droplets adhere to the hot metal surface. This allows for a
				controlled and continuous transfer of heat, a necessary requirement for fuel-injection and combustion
				systems, steam generators, cooling systems for nuclear reactors, and spray quenching systems (Ok et al.,
				2011).</p>
			<p>The incentive to develop technologies that exploit the Leidenfrost effect motivates our present work. The
				engine efficiency of a system that relies on the Leidenfrost effect to produce mechanical work in a
				straight line has not been previously calculated in the literature. However, Wells et al. (2015)
				constructed a Leidenfrost turbine which applies a torque to a solid carbon-dioxide disk, producing
				rotational motion. Their system relied on a similar ratchet like-topography to turn a dry-ice disk which
				sublimated on contact with a superheated aluminium surface (Wells et al., 2015). The engine efficiency
				of the turbine system was reported to be on the order of 1E-06%. In our experiment, two parameters
				thought to affect the dynamics of the water droplet were examined: ratchet angle and droplet volume.
				These parameters were varied within reasonable values based on the available literature.</p>
			<h2>Methods</h2>
			<p>Aluminium slabs were machined to have an asymmetric ratchet-like surface topography (Fig. 1). Table 1
				provides the dimensions of the machined aluminium slabs with 15° and 30° ratchet angles. These
				dimensions closely resemble those studied by Linke et al (2006). The slabs were positioned on a
				hot-plate perpendicular to a Canon T3i® DSLR camera and a thermocouple was used to monitor the surface
				temperature of the slabs. One end of the thermocouple was placed in a beaker of ice-water (0° Celsius)
				and the other was coiled tightly around an accessory aluminium slab, used as a weight, to measure
				hotplate surface temperature. The camera was mounted level to the experimental setup to record
				position-time data. A magnetic-assist pipette was used to control the droplet volume which was varied
				between 15-35 µL in 5 µL increments. Droplets of this size reliably accelerated in the expected
				direction, did not spontaneously divide, and could be manually deposited onto the superheated surface
				with relative ease. A water droplet accelerating due to the Leidenfrost effect after pipetting is shown
				in Fig. 2.</p>
			<p>The hotplate was heated to a temperature well above boiling (335° Celsius), slightly hotter than the
				recorded Leidenfrost temperature for water on aluminium (Bernardin et al., 1999). The aluminium surface
				temperature remained relatively constant throughout (± 7°C) and was monitored closely during
				experimentation using a thermocouple. The entire experimental setup is shown in Fig. 3.</p>
			<p>Initial tests suffered from an unreliable and inconsistent way of depositing stationary droplets on the
				heated aluminium surface. An established protocol (Table 2) was implemented and determined which
				replicates would contribute to the average engine efficiency. The protocol ensured the water droplets
				were initially stationary and were only accelerating due to the Leidenfrost effect. Recorded videos of
				the accepted replicates were analysed using Logger Pro 3® motion-tracking software. The known length of
				the ramp was used as a calibration scale.</p>
			<h3>Efficiency calculation</h3>

			<p>
				Energy efficiency was calculated by measuring the mechanical work done on the Leidenfrost droplet and
				the energy input from the hotplate, as summarized by the following equation:
			</p>

			<figure class="equation">
				<img src="https://cjur.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Arsenau_Philipp_e1.png"
					alt="Energy efficiency equation">
			</figure>

			<p>
				Work refers to mechanical work done in the direction perpendicular to the aluminium ratchets, across the
				full length of the slab. The work for a given replicate was calculated by numerically integrating the
				force function with respect to position, similar to the method used by Linke et al. (&amp;2006).
			</p>

			<figure class="equation">
				<img src="https://cjur.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Arsenau_Philipp_e2.png" alt="">
			</figure>

			<p>Position, velocity, and acceleration was determined using Logger Pro 3® software and a Canon T3i shooting
				at 60fps. Acceleration in the direction across the full length of the aluminium slab was considered
				work; all other acceleration was considered a system inefficiency. Using Newton’s second law and the
				known mass of the water droplet, force was calculated as a function of position. The mass for each water
				droplet was calculated using the known droplet volume and the density of water at room temperature
				(1g/mL). The droplet density was assumed to be that at room temperature as the droplet was
				well-insulated by the vapour layer.</p>
			<p>Instantaneous acceleration was calculated by taking the second-order time derivative of the position-time
				data using finite difference in Logger Pro 3®. The change in position between each time step was
				calculated using position-time data, converting acceleration as a function of time to acceleration as a
				function of position (relative to the initial starting position of the droplet). After obtaining force
				as a function of position, a midpoint rule Riemann sum with a 16.683 ms time-step was used to
				numerically approximate Eq. (2). The standard deviation for work was calculated between replicates of
				the same trial (same droplet volume and ratchet angle).</p>
			<p>Energy input was measured using a power meter. The power input was monitored over a three-hour period and
				a constant power input of 266.67 J/s was observed. The energy input for a given replicate was calculated
				by multiplying the total time the water droplet spent in contact with the aluminium slab, by the
				constant power input. Uncertainty in the power measurement was defined as the digital uncertainty in the
				power meter:</p>

			<h2>Results</h2>

			<p>To determine if we had reproduced the experimental conditions of Linke et al. (2006), we measured the
				average acceleration as a function of droplet volume. Comparing with their Fig. 5, our average droplet
				acceleration for 15° ratchet angle and 30 µL droplet volume, was 0.245 m/s2, which agrees with the value
				obtained by Linke et al. for 30 µL to one significant figure.</p>
			<p>Figures 4 &amp; 5 show the engine efficiency versus droplet volume for Slabs 1 &amp; 2 respectively (see
				Table 1). Fig. 4 shows a relatively large standard deviation for the 30 µL trial which motivated us to
				double the sample size. After taking more measurements, the relatively large standard deviation
				persisted. The sample size was similarly doubled for 30 µL in Fig. 5 to allow for a comparison between
				ratchet angles. A least-squares fit was performed to determine the linearity of the relationship. For
				the steeper 30° ratchet angle, increasing droplet volume in the 15-35 µL range tends to marginally
				improve engine efficiency. The low R2 value in Fig. 5 does not support a similar trend for the shallower
				15° ratchet angle.</p>
			<p>Our Leidenfrost droplet transport system had an extremely low average percent efficiency: 2.86E-07%. This
				is because the average work done on a Leidenfrost droplet was extremely low relative to the energy
				input. The extremely low engine efficiency is not dissimilar to that obtained by Wells et al. (2015)
				which was reported to be on the order of 1E-06%.</p>
			<p>Table 3 compares the mean engine efficiencies between the aluminium slabs with 30° and 15° ratchet
				angles. A two-sample t-Test for equal means was used to infer a change in mean efficiency between slabs:
			</p>
			<figure class="equation">
				<img src="https://cjur.ca/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Arsenau_Philipp_e4.png" alt="">
			</figure>
			<p>
				μ1 and μ2 are the sample means for Slab 1 and Slab 2 respectively, σ1 and σ2 are the sample standard
				deviations, and N1 and N2 are the sample sizes. A p-value (two-tailed), was generated from the two
				sample T-test. A p-value greater than 0.05 does not allow one to conclude that varying ratchet angle
				from 30° to 15° has a statistically meaningful effect on engine efficiency.
			</p>
			<h2>Discussion</h2>

			<p>The discrepancy between our calculated engine efficiency and the engine efficiency calculated by Wells et
				al. (2015) may be explained by the difference in exposed hotplate area. Hotplate area that is not in
				direct contact with the aluminium slab heats the surrounding air which does not contribute to the total
				work. The exposed hotplate area in our experimental setup seems to be larger than the exposed hotplate
				area in Wells et al.’s (2015) experiment. The discrepancy may also be explained by the difference in
				transport load. The maximum load for an insulated carbon-dioxide disk is much larger than the maximum
				load for a stable water droplet. A larger load would increase the work done and therefore increase
				engine efficiency.</p>
			<p>In order to reach the Leidenfrost temperature of water, a large amount of input energy was required.
				Liquids with lower Leidenfrost temperatures would decrease the required energy input and therefore
				increase engine efficiency. Moreover, Leidenfrost ‘carts’ could increase engine efficiency. In a recent
				development by Hashmi et al., loads as massive as 50 g were supported by multiple Leidenfrost droplets
				travelling together. A higher load capacity could dramatically increase the engine efficiency of a
				Leidenfrost droplet transport system and a similar calculation to our present work should be performed
				for the ‘cart’ system.</p>
			<p>Varying the droplet volume and ratchet angle within the experimental values did not have a major effect
				on engine efficiency. Efficiency optimization must be achieved by varying other parameters such as
				ratchet size (Ok et al., 2011), or by making significant design changes to the system.</p>
			<h2>Conclusion</h2>

			<p>
				The engine efficiency of a Leidenfrost droplet transport system, which transports droplets in a straight
				line, was calculated. Our results give an extremely low average percent efficiency (2.86E-07%), which
				agrees with the result from Wells et al. (2015) for an analogous turbine system, to an order of
				magnitude. Differences in exposed hotplate area and maximum load between the two experiments may explain
				the difference in calculated engine efficiency. Droplet volume and ratchet angle were varied in an
				attempt to optimize engine efficiency. Varying the ratchet angle does not affect efficiency to any
				statistically meaningful extent. Increasing droplet volume in the 15-35 µL range tends to marginally
				improve engine efficiency for steep ratchet angles. Further optimization must therefore be achieved by
				varying other parameters such at ratchet size or by making significant design changes to the system.
				Leidenfrost ‘carts’, which rely on multiple Leidenfrost droplets travelling together to support more
				massive loads, may provide a mechanism to dramatically increase the engine efficiency of a Leidenfrost
				droplet transport system.
