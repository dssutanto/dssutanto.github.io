                                On Tuesday, 8 November 2016, the people of the United States elected
                                Donald Trump as their 45th President amidst accusations by both the Republican and
                                Democratic parties of frequent and outright lies communicated to the public through
                                campaign
                                speeches, social media, and news agencies (Hahl et al., 2018). Four years later, the
                                lack of
                                trust in political messaging has increased across the globe to the point where it seems
                                misinformation, ‘fake news’, and ‘alternative facts’ dominating the public narrative
                                have
                                now become the norm (OII, 2019; Vosoughi et al., 2018). Many scholars, news agencies,
                                and
                                world leaders claim that we are living in a ‘post-truth’ political world (Alcorn, 2014;

                                Female juvenile crime is on the rise. In response, some agencies are
                                suggesting a remedy to revise the Canadian Youth Criminal Justice Act in favour of
                                harsher
                                sentences for youth. This paper delves into the potential negative repercussions of said
                                amendment such as increased involvement in gangs and deteriorating mental health.
                                Furthermore, alternative methods such as after school programs, mentorships, and
                                therapeutic
                                means of rehabilitation are shown to not only be more effective for reducing crime among
                                young women but more cost effective as well. Prisons have been shown to worsen the
                                situations of young women who have grown up in extremely disadvantageous circumstances.
                                Thus, this paper argues that harsher sentences for female youth will not only be
                                ineffective
                                in solving the current problem of female youth crime but may make it worse.

                                Despite the immense amount of research completed on adult correctional
                                facilities within North America, little is known about the overrepresentation of visible
                                minority youth within the juvenile justice system. The juvenile justice system is known
                                for
                                violent juvenile offenders, who become and remain habitual offenders. The juvenile
                                justice
                                system then faces questioning for creating professional criminals instead of focusing on
                                effective rehabilitation. The face of the youth justice system within Canada is rapidly
                                changing. Increasing forms of diversity serve as a principal pattern because the
                                criminalization of minority youth occurs from cultural incompetence, unawareness, and
                                insensitivity. This article recovers the institutional or systemic forms of treatment
                                that
                                minority youth face within the criminal justice system. It also further shows that there
                                is
                                little focus on the experiences of minority youth within juvenile correctional
                                facilities
                                due to a lack of information. Racialized and marginalized youth and young adults are
                                apart
                                of the vulnerable population within Canada. One must ensure that youth and young adults
                                who
                                are vulnerable within society, receive the best possible chance at achieve upward
                                mobility.
                                The youth justice system, from a racial justice lens, reveals slave-era origin within
                                youth
                                prisons, limiting opportunities for racialized youth across Canada. Racial antagonism
                                within
                                the youth justice system leads to the criminalization of minority youth, which serves as
                                a
                                foundation for why culture shapes the identity of racialized youth.

                                Pride emerged as a radical demonstration of the lesbian, gay, bisexual,
                                transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) civil rights movement. Over the years, its purpose and
                                form
                                have evolved. While Pride is a necessary source of LGBTQ representation, it often fails
                                to
                                observe the intersectionality within its community, resulting in racism, ableism,
                                sexism,
                                homophobia, classism, and homonormativity. This essay explores this lack of
                                intersectionality, drawing on Nanaimo Pride as a source of discussion, with references
                                to
                                celebrations in Edmonton, Toronto, and New York. It concludes by offering suggestions
                                for
                                making Pride more inclusive.

                                Vascular Dementia (VaD) is the second most common cause of dementia and
                                accounts for up to 20 percent of diagnosed cases in the USA (Rohn, 2014). VaD is
                                characterized by the loss of cognitive function due to a variety of cerebrovascular or
                                car-diovascular conditions that lead to ischemic, hem-orrhagic, or hypoperfusive brain
                                lesions (Roman, 2003; Choi et al., 2016). One key feature of VaD that contributes to its
                                pathophysiology is hypoxia, or reduced oxygen supply to tissues.

                                The Schengen Agreement has been a prime example of European integration,
                                providing citizens of member states the unique experience of travelling across borders
                                without the inconvenience of border checks. However, the recent peak in the flow of
                                refugees
                                and a changing political environment has challenged the agreement and put the future of
                                open
                                borders in Europe into question. This article initially establishes the background on
                                the
                                Schengen and Dublin conventions, the benefits they have brought to member states, and
                                the
                                role they have played in European integration. Subsequently, the challenges brought by
                                refugees and the reactions of European nations are discussed and finally, the attempts
                                by
                                members to address the current challenges are assessed. In summary, I argue that the
                                situation can only be resolved with political will from all member states in order to
                                make
                                the tough decisions required to maintain an achievement that was itself reached after a
                                collective effort by all member states. There is also a need to realize the extra burden
                                that frontier states are bearing and the need for sharing the responsibility of any
                                collective decision. Inaction or counterproductive measures would either challenge the
                                moral
                                responsibility of the EU in protecting those risking their lives to reach its shores or
                                result in the end of a borderless Schengen zone. Both scenarios are undesired,
                                underscoring
                                the importance of robust, collective action.

                                On March 26, 1947, in a testimony before the House Un-American Activities
                                Committee (HUAC), FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover laid out the prevalent world-view towards
                                American communism. In the testimony, Hoover asserted that, “The Communist movement in
                                the
                                United States… stands for the destruction of our American form of government; it stands
                                for
                                the destruction of American democracy; it stands for the destruction of free enterprise;
                                and
                                it stands for the creation of a ‘Soviet of the United States’ and ultimate world
                                revolution”. Hoover was not alone in having these views. The supposedly unprecedented
                                danger
                                that Communism posed to the American way of life became a mania that percolated
                                throughout
                                the whole society. This paranoia formed the period known as the ‘Second Red Scare’ of
                                late
                                1940s until the middle 1950's. The Communist ‘witch hunt’ targeted all levels of the
                                United
                                States from the local schoolteacher to the highest reaches of the American government.
                                The
                                drive to root out not just the minuscule number of Soviet spies, but also the much
                                larger
                                Communist Party and its sympathizers, was far from spontaneous. Anti-Communism pervaded
                                much
                                of the American public at this time, spearheaded especially by a loose coalition of
                                politicians, businesses, religious and patriotic orders, and investigation agencies.
                                This
                                undercurrent, combined with unsettling international events, allowed the Second Red
                                Scare to
                                explode into the spotlight. The emergence and perpetuation of the Red Scare was a result
                                of
                                the long-standing anti-Communist sentiment in America taking advantage of the setbacks
                                in
                                the early years of the Cold War.

                            <a href="feb2017/188656-health-as-a-trade.html">Transnational advocacy networks played a
                                crucial role in the acceptance of the right to health as a trade concern that takes
                                precedence over intellectual property (IP) protections. The development and influence
                                of this norm is reflected in interna-tional responses to the 1998-2001 South African
                                litigation over access to medicines. In the process of pressuring an army of
                                pharmaceutical firms to back down from an unjust legal challenge, the transnational
                                advocacy network surrounding access to AIDS medicines transformed the case from a
                                largely trade-focused issue to a human rights issue. The right to health was thus
                                brought to the world of international trade.</a>

                                Turkey is in the midst of a little-publicized conflict with its ethnic
                                Kurdish population in the southeast of the country. The Kurds in the east have long been
                                repressed by the Turkish government, as they do not share an identity with the Turkish
                                majority peoples, and as such have waged several conflicts against the Turkish
                                government
                                for many decades. The Turkish government has long fought both a military and propaganda
                                war
                                against the Kurds, with the major condemnation of the Kurds coming from the official
                                labelling of the major Kurdish militant faction as a “terrorist” organization. As a
                                result,
                                and due to Turkey’s role as a major strategic partner within the North Atlantic Treaty
                                Organization and a strong partner of the European Union, Ankara’s allies also consider
                                some
                                Kurdish militant factions as terrorists, posing a major barrier to reconcile the
                                conflicting forces. Often, the Turkish military, which has tremendous capabili-ty and
                                recruitment capacity, have launched large-scale battles against Kurdish forces, who are
                                often under-equipped and wage guerrilla warfare against a highly-skilled and organized
                                force.
