			<h3>
				Introduction
			</h3>
			<p>
				To look at one’s self in the mirror and say, “I like who I am” or “I am worthwhile”, and truly mean it is
				not a simple task for most individuals. Yet these subjective evaluations of our-selves – our self-esteem,
				are incredibly influential on a wide range of outcomes. Past research has shown that self-esteem is related
				to academic achievement (Marsh, 1990), happiness (Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger, & Vohs, 2005; Taylor &
				Brown, 1988) and psychological well-being (Kernis, 2003). These findings are especially significant for
				children, as the development of self-esteem in early childhood may have major implications throughout their
				course of life. Therefore, extensive research is necessary to begin applying our knowledge of self-esteem
				development in order to examine specific parental practices and techniques that promote healthy self-esteem
				in children across cultures. However, previous research has been based predominantly on the use of explicit
				measures of self-esteem such as parental report or child self-report (Li-Hua, Li-Zhu, & Fang, 2006;
				Rosenberg & Pearlin, 1978). This may be an issue as explicit measures of self-esteem for children are
				limited (Hughes, 1984) and inherently susceptible to response sets such as social desirability (Nosek &
				Greenwald, 2005). As well, explicit measures potentially paint an incomplete picture with respect to an
				individual’s self-esteem; self-reports may not necessarily mirror an individual’s nonconscious or implicit
				feelings of self-worth (Hofmann, Gawronski, Gschwendner, Le, & Schmitt, 2005). In this paper, I advocate for
				the use of a non-deliberative implicit model to help mitigate these issues when studying children’s
				self-esteem. I will provide arguments emphasizing the need for a multifaceted approach with respect to the
				study and application of self-esteem research in children and to determine specific factors, such as
				parental style, that encourage its positive development. Implicit measures for children will be outlined to
				determine their validity and reliability for future research and directions for future research advocating a
				holistic and multicultural approach to the study of self-esteem will be discussed.
			</p>
	
			<h3>
				Benefits of Studying Implicit Self-Esteem in Children
			</h3>
			<p>Although there has been extensive research into the development of self-esteem in children, most of these
				studies have relied on an explicit measure of self-esteem through parents or teachers (Fuchs-Beauchamp,
				1996; Hughes & Pugh, 1984) as well as through children’s self-report (Hughes, 1984). One potential
				limitation with this approach is that explicit measures can be affected by response sets such as social
				desirability (Greenwald, McGhee & Schwartz, 1998) as well as self-enhancement biases (Taylor & Brown, 1988).
				On the other hand, implicit self-esteem, which is defined as an “automatic and nonconscious evaluation of
				the self that guides spontaneous reactions to self-relevant stimuli” (Greenwald & Banaji, 2005; Pelham &
				Hetts, 1999), may be less susceptible to these biases. This is due to the fact that implicit measures of
				self-esteem reduce the available mental control required to produce the response and mitigate the role of
				intentional processes (Nosek, Greenwald, & Banaji, 2007). Implicit measures provide an “automatic” and
				“non-deliberative” representation of an individual’s attitude and thus, may be a more reliable indicator of
				their true attitude (Nosek et al., 2007).</p>
			<p>Implicit self-esteem has been implicated in various aspects of mental well-being, such as by acting as a
				buffer against adverse consequences of failure (Greenwald & Farnham, 2000), as well as mediating anxiety in
				self-relevant interviews (Spalding & Hardin, 1999). Research by Hetts and Pelham (1999) also highlights the
				importance of implicit self-esteem as it may aid in coping against stigmatization. In light of these
				potential benefits of positive implicit self-esteem, it is clear that utilizing an implicit model may prove
				largely beneficial in developmental research, especially in its application to find specific factors such as
				specific types of parental style that promote positive development of self-esteem.</p>
	
			<h3>
				Parental Style and Children’s Self-Esteem
			</h3>
			<p>One domain that has been of particular interest to researchers is the development of children’s self-esteem
				in relation to parental style. Previous studies have investigated the differential effects of parental
				rearing styles on self-esteem across an individual’s lifespan and in different cultural contexts
				(Antonopoulou, Alexopoulos, & Maridaki-Kassotaki, 2012; Furham & Cheng, 2000; Herz & Gullone, 1999).
				Specific studies have provided empirical evidence that an authoritative parenting approach (Baumrind, 1971)
				is related to higher self-esteem in childhood (Li-Hua et al., 2006) and adolescence (Milevsky, Schlechter,
				Netter, & Keehn, 2007). Furthermore, research has provided support for the importance of self-esteem in its
				relation to individuals’ psychological well-being with respect to both depression (Dumont & Provost, 1999)
				and happiness (Furnham & Cheng, 2000). However, past research tends to examine parental styles and their
				relation to the development of self-esteem through a Western-centric lens and may not be generalizable to
				all cultures. In support of this account, one study found that Brazilian adolescents from indulgent families
				had comparable social and academic outcomes, as well as greater self-esteem when compared to adolescents of
				parents that advocated an authoritative style (Martinez, Garcia, & Yubero, 2007). As well, research into
				East Asian cultures show that the Chinese have specific concepts embedded in their traditions and language
				that associates parental love and care with firm governance of the child (Chao, 1994). One implication of
				this cultural norm is that authoritarian parenting style tends to lead to better outcomes in Chinese
				households that have adopted these values, in comparison to authoritative parenting.</p>
			<p>Although there has been extensive research examining the relationship between parental style and self-esteem,
				the studies have primarily focused on an explicit form of self-esteem. Less research has been devoted to
				examining the effects of implicit self-esteem especially in children despite its potential significance.
				Indeed, Jordan, Spencer, Zanna, Hoshino-Browne, and Correll (2003) highlights the importance of taking a
				holistic approach in studying self-esteem to develop a more accurate picture of an individual’s personality
				traits. Specifically, they found that a combination of high explicit self-esteem and low implicit
				self-esteem is related to greater defensiveness and higher levels of narcissism in undergraduate students.
				The aforementioned example provides insight into the necessity and utility in advancing an implicit model to
				study self-esteem. This gap in research is especially prominent and concerning in the developmental field as
				the development of self-esteem may begin as early as 3 years of age (Li-Hua et al., 2006).</p>
			<p>However, in order to begin investigating implicit self-esteem in children, we must first consider the
				plausibility of measuring the construct through examining previous validated implicit measures of
				self-esteem.</p>
	
			<h3>
				Implicit Measures of Self-Esteem in Children
			</h3>
			<p>
				The vast majority of methodology dedicated to measuring implicit self-esteem has focused on catering to the
				adult population (Greenwald & Banaji, 1995; Greenwald & Farnham, 2000). However, there have been recent
				advances in the development of implicit measures for children. For example, Cvencek, Greenwald, and Meltzoff
				(2011) successfully adapted the original Implicit Association Test (IAT) by Greenwald et al. (1998) to be
				accessible for children as young as 4-years-old. They found that this child-friendly version of the IAT was
				sensitive to evaluative preference for flowers over insects. In addition, the study found that implicit
				preferences for flowers were stronger in girls than in boys, as demonstrated in a previous study by Baron
				and Banaji (2006), thus providing greater convergent validity. Furthermore, a recent study by Cvencek,
				Greenwald, and Meltzoff (2016) used this Preschool Implicit Association Test (PSIAT) to examine implicit
				self-esteem in young children. The self-esteem PSIAT is a double-categorization task that combines a concept
				classification (me vs. not-me) and an attribute classification (good vs. bad), with these dimensions
				represented as pictures and words (Cvencek et al., 2011). This task provides a measure of implicit
				self-esteem by comparing response latency to infer the strength of association between two dimensions. Thus,
				children who have higher positive implicit self-esteem will respond more quickly when the attribute
				classification is congruent (good) compared to when the attribute is incongruent (bad).
			</p>
	
			<h3>
				General Conclusions and Future Directions
			</h3>
			<p>There clearly exists great value in examining self-esteem in children due to the various outcomes correlated
				with the construct, such as its relationship with mental health (Lloyd & Miller, 1997) and life-satisfaction
				(Milevsky et al., 2007). Past research has also shown that various constructs are better predicted by
				measures of implicit self-esteem, including persistence in failure and coping against stigmatization (Hetts
				& Pelham, 1999; Greenwald & Farnham, 2000). Thus, implicit self-esteem may tap into important constructs
				that are less associated with explicit self-esteem. As well, studies have shown that incongruence in
				implicit and explicit self-esteem is linked to narcissism and greater defensiveness in adolescence (Jordan
				et al., 2003). This suggests the importance of taking an implicit model into consideration in order to to
				provide a more complete and accurate account of a child’s self-esteem. Further research using this model to
				examine the factors that impact self-esteem will be useful in determining the ideal conditions for a child’s
				growth. Thus, it will be necessary to focus on further developing reliable and valid implicit measures of
				self-esteem that are accessible for young children. In addition, specific parental practices may have
				differential effects on self-esteem development depending on the values and attitudes of an individual’s
				culture (Herz & Gullone, 1999; Wang & Ollendick, 2001). Thus, future research may also benefit from
				cross-cultural studies to determine specific parental styles that are associated with the healthy
				development of implicit and explicit self-esteem in young children within different cultural milieus.</p>
			<p>Although a major part of this paper is dedicated to the exploration of potential benefits and possibilities
				of using an implicit model to study children’s self-esteem, it is important to recognize that future
				research will benefit most from examining implicit self-esteem and explicit self-esteem in tandem. Indeed,
				research has shown that it is the congruence of self-esteem in both domains that is essential when
				considering future outcomes (Jordan et al., 2003; Zeigler-Hill, 2006). Through employing these models
				together, we can begin to create a more holistic and accurate picture of the development of self-esteem in
				children. In doing so, we can extend and apply these findings to determine specific parental practices and
				environmental factors that foster positive self-esteem, both explicitly and implicitly.</p>
