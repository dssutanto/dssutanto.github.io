		<div class="article">
			<p>Turkey is in the midst of a little-publicised conflict with its ethnic Kurdish population in the south east
				of the country. The Kurds in the east have long been repressed by the Turkish government, as they do not
				share an identity with the Turkish majority peoples, and as such have waged several conflicts against the
				Turkish government for many decades. The Turkish government has long fought both a military and propaganda
				war against the Kurds, with the major condemnation of the Kurds coming from the official labelling of the
				major Kurdish militant faction as a “terrorist” organisation. As a result, and due to Turkey’s role as a
				major strategic partner within the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation and a strong partner of the European
				Union, Ankara’s allies also consider some Kurdish militant factions as terrorists, posing a major barrier to
				reconcile the conflicting forces. Often, the Turkish military, which has tremendous capability and
				recruitment capacity, have launched large-scale battles against Kurdish forces, who are often under-equipped
				and wage guerrilla warfare against a highly-skilled and organised force.</p>
			<p>In light of the current conflict, which began in mid-2015, the Turkish government securitised the conflict as
				a matter of concern-but only in a domestic setting. The Turkish government urged its allies (namely, NATO
				and the EU countries) to not interfere in the conflict-whether it be politically or economically, Ankara has
				assured that it is handling the conflict. This poses problems for Ankara’s allies, as the Kurds in the
				Middle East have proven effective non-state allies in the current conflict against the Islamic State of Iraq
				and the Levant (henceforth known as Daesh).</p>
			<p>This paper poses the question: why has the Turkish government domestically securitised the current Kurdish
				conflict, while asking its allies not to interfere, thus desecuritising the issue internationally? In
				answering this question, several steps will be taken to ensure an accurate a portrayal of the conflict can
				be given. First, a brief overview of the Kurdish conflict will give the reader an historical basis for the
				context. Second, the current conflict’s history will be described concisely due to the complexity and the
				recent nature of the matter. From this point forward, academic sources cease to be an effective research
				tool. The conflict is indeed very recent, and relatively little has been published on the subject. As such,
				primary sources and investigative journalism will be used for a large portion of this essay. Further will
				this essay discuss the factors leading to the Turkish government’s decision to securitise the conflict
				domestically, and the factors leading it to request its allies not interfere. In conjunction with this, the
				essay will discuss why Ankara’s allies have indeed not commented on the issue, and what factors may
				contribute to their need to keep Turkey as a strong and placated ally. This essay hypothesises that the
				Turkish government has securitised the Kurdish conflict domestically by claiming the Kurdish Worker’s Party
				militant group (PKK) are terrorists and threaten Turkish territory, national unity, and domestic security
				interests; simultaneously, the Turkish government has desecurtised the conflict abroad by requesting its
				allies respect the autonomy of Turkey to monopolise violence on its territory and prioritise other regional
				issues involving Turkey.</p>
			<p>The Kurds are an ancient ethnic group spread across Turkey, Iran, Iraq, and Syria. They were not recognised
				as a distinct group by the Ottomans, and this lack of designation has carried into the secular Turkish
				Republic. The Kurds are ethnically and linguistically different from the Turks, but legally have had their
				identity forcibly removed-there is no provision in Turkish law for different ethnicities, all citizens are
				considered Turks. This is the baseline for the division in Turkey between Kurds and Turks, but the origins
				of the Turkish-Kurdish conflict are deeper. In 1924, the new Turkish Republic abolished the Kurdish
				caliphate system, which allowed for some autonomy of the Kurds in their territories. As a result, combined
				with the Treaty of Lausanne that guaranteed the territory of modern Turkey as it is today, this angered the
				Kurds, who launched successive revolts in 1925 and 1927. A third rebellion in 1936 resulted in the crushing
				defeat of the Kurdish forces, and the banning of non-Turkish nationality-effectively banning Kurdish-ness.
			</p>
			<p>The origins of the current conflict lie in the creation of the nationalist and socialist Kurdish Workers
				Party (PKK) in 1978. Headed by Abdullah Ocalan, the party provided a platform for Kurds to air their
				grievances against the government, namely calling for language and cultural expression in their territories.
				These calls for expression and eventually autonomy fell on deaf ears, and in 1984, the PKK launched an
				insurgency against the Turkish state. This conflict ended in 2000, with many thousands of people dead and
				villages destroyed. However, the major turning point in the conflict and context for the current conflict
				comes from 1998, when Ocalan was forced to flee from Syria (his long time hideout) to Italy. In Europe, he
				was rejected asylum and entry on terrorism charges, and was arrested in Kenya years later. From prison,
				Ocalan called for Kurdish unity, and for Kurdish fighters to leave Turkey. This call for unity led to the
				creation of Kurdish political parties, and Kurdish engagement with the Turkish state. In 2008, remnants of
				the PKK formed the Peace and Democracy Party, and in 2009 the Erdoğan government allowed Kurdish
				broadcasting rights, amnesty for PKK fighters, and allowing Kurdish to be taught in schools. However, the
				stigma around the PKK and the Kurds as terrorists remains, despite the political advances of Kurdish
				political parties.</p>
			<p>The current conflict is another flare-up of tensions, but additional factors in the Middle East region led to
				the conflict. In 2015, the Kurdish political party People’s Democratic Party won a large enough share in
				parliamentary elections to force president Erdoğan to form a coalition. A short time later, the terrorist
				group Daesh bombed a Kurdish town, killing nearly 30 civilians. PKK leader Ocalan accused the Turkish
				military of not doing enough to prevent the attack, seemingly as the attack affected Kurds, not Turks.
				Following this attack, a reportedly Daesh-initiated suicide bomb at a political rally in Ankara killed over
				100 people-and the Turkish government blamed the attack on PKK terrorists, despite the attendance of
				pro-Kurdish protesters. This led to the breakdown of a Turkish-Kurdish ceasefire, and combat operations in
				Turkey’s east began once more.</p>
			<p>In the first two months of 2016, more than 140 Turkish police officers and soldiers have died, and as of
				March 2016, nearly 350 000 civilians have been displaced with the Kurdish regions. Turkish army vehicles and
				armoured vehicles are laying siege to Kurdish towns, and imposing curfews in Kurdish territories. For the
				Turkish military, “curfew” has more relation to encirclement and the total siege by armoured vehicles of a
				town rather than imposing timed curfews on civilians. This is, however, not an equal conflict. Troop numbers
				are unavailable for either side in this conflict, but the Turkish army is roughly 700 000 strong overall.
				However, discrepancies appear when hardware and training are discussed. Nearly</p>
			<p>470 000 Turkish troops are conscripts, and as a whole, the Turkish land forces lack more sophisticated
				intelligence technology to take on the industrious Kurds. The Kurds, meanwhile, have gained access to new
				weapons previously unavailable, such as shoulder fired missiles used to allegedly neutralise a Turkish
				military helicopter. This asymmetrical conflict is taking a toll on Turkey at a time when its public
				resources are stretched thinly by other conflicts.</p>
			<p>There are other factors at work in the Middle East that have contributed to the rise of Turkish-Kurdish
				tensions and conflict. The Arab Spring revolutions of December 2010 and January 2011 greatly destabilised
				the entire Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region, and none more so than Syria. Syria has been locked in
				a civil war since 2011, and many millions of Syrians have been internally displaced as well as forced to
				flee Syria’s territory. Turkey has absorbed some 2.73 million refugees from Syria, and is attempting to
				control its porous borders both to its south and to its west, with Europe. Simultaneously, Turkey has agreed
				to support the US in fighting Daesh in Syria. This support, in late July 2015, has coincided with the start
				date of the Turkish initiating strikes against Kurdish militants. This creates a problem for Turkey and the
				US, as the US is working closely with Kurdish groups in Syria to help combat Daesh. Some Kurdish troops are
				originally from Turkey and Iraq, and having an American ally launch airstrikes against their homelands is
				deeply unsettling. Turkey is even launching airstrikes against PKK and Kurdish positions in Iraqi Kurdistan.
				The Turkish government has stated that they will not tolerate a new Kurdish state on their Syrian border,
				and this is the reason for the strikes, but one must not forget the labelling of the PKK as terrorists as a
				potential reason for Ankara to attack the Kurds.</p>
			<p>To formally discuss the issue of the Kurdish “question” in security terms, this essay will begin to discuss
				how the Turkish government has securitised the perceived threats, and to whom. The Turkish government
				initially securitised the issue when they designated the PKK as a terrorist organisation. This designation
				was strengthened in 2002, when the US, EU, and UK governments added the PKK to their terrorism watch lists.
				Immediately, the issue was classified as disruptive militancy, and thus warranted military measures to
				combat the Kurds. The question of why the Turkish government opposes Kurdish nationalism or advancement in
				any shape or form is simply answered as: Turkey values territorial integrity and stability above all else.
				President Erdoğan in particular, favours a stable state with all citizens working together for mutual
				benefit. However, the Kurds have never shared in this vision, as they have clamoured for an independent
				Kurdish state, and have always fought against the Turkish state. This firmly places the Kurds and their
				political and militant organisations firmly in the “terrorist” category for the Turks. A clear statement to
				support this is by president Erdoğan himself, quoted as “My people don’t want to see those supported by the
				separatist terrorist organization in parliament,” in reference to a recent vote to lift political immunity
				from Kurdish political parties in parliament in light of the violence, which passed into law. The view that
				the Kurds are terrorists is clearly outlined by the Turkish government, and has responded to the Kurdish
				conflict as they feel necessary. Immediately, one can also see, in Erdoğan’s comment, the use of a “we”
				followed by an implicit “they.” The “we” is to refer to Turks, or those who are not Kurds, whilst the “they”
				is to refer to those who do identify as Kurds. This method of othering is not meant to dehumanise the Kurds;
				rather, it is to securitise the conflict even further. As nationality beyond Turkish-ness is outlawed,
				anyone in opposition to this can be perceived as a threat to Turkish society and state.</p>
			<p>The Turkish government has declared the Kurdish PKK terrorists, and have used this designation to both
				convince their allies of the PKK’s terrorist-hood as well as to quell this perceived threat-but this
				warrants the question “What have the PKK done to receive this designation?” Following this question is where
				this essay will examine, in conjunction with the Turkish government’s securitisation of the Kurdish
				conflict, the concept of “one [person’s] terrorist is another [person’s] freedom fighter.” The PKK have used
				tactics, often learnt from other organisations labelled as terrorists, that warrant the terrorist label. For
				example, in the current conflict, PKK soldiers (or militants-either term carries a certain unavoidable
				politics) have been seen to use improvised explosive devices, similar to those used in Iraq by al-Qaeda,
				which has become Daesh. It is primarily the use of tactics that differentiate the Kurds and the PKK from
				other rebel groups. However, one must question whether the term “terrorist” is a term of convenience for the
				Turkish government. Certainly, the PKK has received training from terror organisations such as al-Qaeda, but
				according to the Atlantic Council, the use of well-trained snipers has been heavily written about in Turkish
				media. These snipers are reportedly veterans from fighting in northern Syria for Rojava.</p>
			<p>Numerous other tactics typical of insurgencies have been employed by the PKK in eastern Turkey, including
				civilian bomb attacks and hostage taking of Turkish soldiers in the past. The case for making the PKK a
				terrorist organisation is also legally described. The US State Department, in its definition of a foreign
				terrorist organisation, clearly states in criterion 3: “The organization’s terrorist activity or terrorism
				must threaten the security of U.S. nationals or the national security (national defense, foreign relations,
				or the economic interests) of the United States.” This description clearly marks the PKK as a terrorist
				organisation for the United States-the PKK threatens the territorial security of an American ally- and if
				Turkey were to apply this domestically, then the PKK would also fit as a terrorist organisation. One
				possible explanation for the turn to traditional extremist or terrorist tactics by the PKK could be the
				realisation that traditional military tactics would never work against a formal military force. For the
				relatively under-equipped PKK, the Turkish military is still a formidable force. This statement may be in
				defence of the “freedom fighter” term for the PKK, but regardless of position taken, the PKK has used
				extreme tactics to fight a war against a superior military force.</p>
			<p>Erdoğan has made several speeches regarding the Kurdish conflict, comments which may show that he stands to
				gain from attacking the Kurds. Before the November 2015 elections, Erdoğan stated that the PKK and the Kurds
				were the number one threat to Turkey at that time. His comments and securitisation were successful, as the
				public did indeed reference the Kurds as the most pressing threat, and Erdoğan was elected as president
				again. From the Kurdish perspective, some Kurdish politicians believe that Erdoğan has used an agreement
				with the US to fight Daesh as a reason to fight the Kurds instead. This follows that Erdoğan and Ankara fear
				the territorial gains made by Kurds in Syria, and fear the existence of both Rojava and Iraqi Kurdistan.</p>
			<p>In summary of the above arguments, the Turkish government securitised the Kurdish conflict and the PKK by
				declaring these actors as threats to several aspects of Turkey. The Turkish government declared the PKK and
				the Kurds a threat to national unity, as non-Turkish nationality is outlawed, yet the Kurds are identifying
				as a separate ethnic group. The Kurds are perceived as a threat to Turkish territory as defined by the
				Lausanne treaty, and therefore must be stopped from accomplishing their territorial ambitions. Finally, the
				Turkish government perceives the Kurds to be terrorists, as they have and do employ terrorist tactics, which
				were learnt from other terrorist organisations in the region. These tactics have been used to capture and
				kill Turkish soldiers and civilians, and therefore warrant the designation of terrorist. These three
				arguments form the core of the Turkish government’s claim to securitise the Kurdish conflict, and they have
				done so successfully. The next section of this essay will discuss Ankara’s attempt to persuade its allies to
				not become involved in the Kurdish conflict-desecuritising the issue-and the responses of its allies.</p>
			<p>Two months after the beginning of violence between the Turkish government and the PKK, president Erdoğan
				requested that its allies, notably the US and NATO countries, should refrain from commenting and interfering
				in its conflict with the Kurds. This desecuritisation of Turkey’s conflict with the Kurds is interesting to
				discuss, as desecuritisation is largely a vague topic and can take numerous forms. However, desecuritisation
				can be seen as akin to depoliticisation:</p>
	
			<span class="quote">“the analyst in making an evaluation of a particular securitisation, must always determine
				the nature of the security relations in relation to the alternative - politicisation - and determine whether
				or not the securitisation achieved a better overall policy than the politicisation could have done. To
				reiterate, this evaluation of positive/negative does not result from the analyst's personal preferences, but
				rather must follow a rigorous analytical and practical evaluation of what kind of security best addresses
				insecurity.” </span>
	
			<p>As this is an interpretation of what desecuritisation can mean, Turkey’s move to “play down” the issue of the
				Kurdish conflict to its neighbours is but one example of numerous desecuritisation attempts in different
				conflicts and issues in different spaces and times. However, the Turkish case is significant, because it
				entails a government engaged in a war that it has already securitised domestically-but is requesting
				outsiders not interfere. It is different, in that Turkey never securitised the issue to a non-domestic
				audience prior to its desecuritisation. It has become a dichotomy of pursuing a threat at home, but abroad
				convincing other national actors that the Kurdish conflict is not an issue to be concerned about.</p>
			<p>As mentioned towards the beginning of this paper, the Turkish campaign against the PKK and the Kurds
				coincided with the agreement to allow the US military use of Turkish air bases to fight Daesh from Turkey.
				This has raised concerns regarding the Turkish government’s true intentions-largely the US is worried that
				the Turkish government is using the excuse of supporting strikes against fundamental Islamic militants by
				striking against the PKK-as the PKK are listed as terrorists. As discussed earlier, the president stood to
				gain politically at election time by quelling a Kurdish resistance and appealing to Turkish nationalists. As
				quoted by a senior Turkish official, when discussing the desecuritisation of the Kurdish conflict:</p>
	
			<span class="quote">“‘Turkey will share its experience with world leaders to seek support to prevent the Middle
				East from becoming a region that exports terrorism to the world,” ...“The Prime Minister will also highlight
				that certain countries and organisations should refrain from attitudes that encourage and support PKK and
				other groups for permanent stability in the Middle East.‘“ </span>
	
			<p>In essence, whilst the Turkish government has lended itself legitimacy by ensuring the case for maintaining
				the PKK’s position on the terrorist organisation list is proven, it has taken the opportunity to request its
				allies refrain from becoming involved. But this not the only factor for Turkey’s action against the Kurds.
				The Turkish military has been able to act with only minor criticism from its allies, and in the subsequent
				arguments, the responses of the US and the EU will be analysed.</p>
			<p>It is pertinent to note that the US and the EU are the strongest allies of Turkey, and play two separate
				roles. The US is largely the military support, with its origins in the stationing of missiles on Turkish
				soil to contain the Soviets in the Cuban Missile Crisis. As noted earlier, the US needed the use of Turkish
				air bases in order to launch attacks on Daesh. Crucial to the American mission to combat Daesh has been the
				support of the Kurds in Rojava. The US has relied heavily on the Kurdish People’s Protection Units and
				Women’s Protection Units (YPG and YPJ), and sacrificing their support to please Turkey is not in the US’
				interests.</p>
			<p>The US has been attempting to wade through a political quagmire that has become the Syrian conflict. Daesh
				has claimed vast swathes of land across Syria and Iraq, but various groups are attempting to force Daesh to
				retreat. The US has been relying on the Kurdish militias, who have drawn troops from Iraq, Syria, Iran, and
				Turkey to help fight against Daesh. However, this has angered Turkey-Turkey views the Kurdish militias as
				terrorists, seeing as they have links to the PKK. These links are not well established nor are they easily
				seen: these links entail the interchangeable identities of fighters on the ground, some weaponry and
				financial support to the Kurdish militias, and political support for the Kurdish territories of Rojava.
				American support of the Kurdish militias in Syria has naturally angered the Turkish government, as the
				government does not believe there is a difference between Kurdish groups-they are all PKK affiliates, and
				are all threats.</p>
			<p>The US, however, has valued the support of the Kurds enough that they have disregarded the Turkish
				government’s objections to the American military’s support of Kurdish troops. Earlier in 2016, the US
				military withdrew its support for a deal struck between Turkey and the US, that the US would support troops
				in Syria that are Arab. The US had fought alongside Kurdish troops enough to see that the Kurds were the
				more able and organised force in the region, and determined again that it is in American interests to
				support the Kurds in larger military operations. According to the US military, these operations were carried
				out with the support of the Turkish government-despite being angered by American indignance to side with
				supposed terrorists.</p>
			<p>There are tensions brewing between the US and Turkish governments over the issue of supporting Syrian
				Kurds-noticeably, the US has stayed relatively silent on the conflict in eastern Turkey. The US has
				requested the Turkish military refrain from shelling Kurdish troops in Syria-the Turkish military frequently
				targets Kurdish militia that are attacking targets near the Turkish border, as Turkey believes these
				targets, once secured, could strengthen the Kurdish hold on territory in northern Syria. Effectively, the US
				is having to support two allies, that are fighting each other. But the US has been silent on the issue of
				the Turkish-Kurdish conflict. The US has an interest in maintaining the support of both Turkey and the Kurds
				fighting in Syria. However, Turkey has more capacity to assist the US, by providing air bases and supply
				lines. The lack of any securitisation or politicisation of the Kurdish conflict may be partially respecting
				the wishes of the Turkish government, a strong NATO ally, as well as wishing to maintain relations with
				Turkey due to the strategic importance of Turkey in regional and global affairs.</p>
			<p>The European Union and Turkey have a much deeper relationship, and the EU is largely the political and
				economic supporter of Turkey. Turkey conducts the majority of its trade with the EU in a Customs agreement
				from 1995; Turkey applied for EU membership in 1999, and has been working through the accession agreements
				since. The major strain in relations between the Turkish government and the EU is over the Syrian refugee
				crisis. To reiterate, Turkey has absorbed 2.73 million refugees from Syria and is needing more support from
				allies to help deal with the rising cost of supporting the major influx of people into its territory. But
				many refugees have used Turkey as a transit country in order to make their way to the EU. As has been
				heavily publicised, the co-ordinated (or lack thereof) response to the refugee crisis has been draining on
				the EU and its member countries. As such, the EU and the Turkish governments have worked to arrange a deal
				on how to deal with the crisis. In the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan, several crucial policy points include:
				the returning of refugees crossing from Turkey to Greece illegally; the agreement to resettle a refugee
				processed in Turkey into the EU for every refugee returned to Turkey from Greece, and a humanitarian
				assistance package of 3 billion EUR to help Turkey in settling, housing, and feeding Syrian refugees within
				its borders. This is in exchange for accelerating the accession process of Turkey into the EU, and the
				lifting of visa restrictions of Turkish nationals to travel in the Schengen zone.</p>
			<p>The agreement has already encountered implementation issues due to concerns over human rights abuses by the
				Turkish authorities of Syrian refugees-an issue that could be exacerbated should the EU criticise Turkey’s
				involvement against its Kurdish population. Reportedly, Syrian refugees are facing starvation, imprisonment,
				and lack of access to medical treatment in Turkish internment camps, which the EU and its member states have
				criticised. The EU has withheld the relaxing of visa requirements for travel in the Schengen zone, due to
				these humanitarian concerns. The Turkish government has been steadfast, and has threatened to cancel the
				agreement entirely should the EU continue to refuse the deal’s provisions.</p>
			<p>Should the Turkish government unilaterally rescind its agreement to the EU-Turkey Joint Action Plan, this
				would cause all progress in mitigating the Syrian refugee crisis to crumble. The EU needs Turkish support in
				the crisis, but losing that support is nearing, as the Turkish government is dictating the rules to the EU.
				The EU allowed a certain amount of discretion for the Turkish government to determine who is sent to the EU
				and who is forced to stay. As of the present, the Turkish government has approved a disportionate amount of
				ill and injured Syrians to travel to the EU, whilst banning Syrian academics and doctors from travel.</p>
			<p>With the Turkish government requesting its allies refrain from commenting or interfering in the Kurdish
				conflict, the EU is very nearly prevented from overriding Turkey and securitising the issue. The EU is
				dependent on Turkish support: should the Turks be angered further, the deal will fall apart. Yet the EU has
				been more vocal about the conflict than the US has been. In two statements, the EU has twice spoken out
				against the human rights abuses in eastern Turkey. From one MEP, “We also express our concern about the
				escalation of violence in the southeast of Turkey, which caused almost 400,000 people to leave their
				houses,” and from the EU’s Foreign Policy chief Federica Mogherini:</p>
	
			<span class="quote">“There is a need to restart the Kurdish peace process. The European Union recognizes that
				PKK is a terrorist organization, but there is a need to re-engage from the Turkish authorities’ side with
				the Kurdish political representatives and the ones that express their position in a peaceful way.” </span>
	
			<p>Perhaps most forceful in its convictions of the conflict is the Council of Europe, from which Nils Muiznieks
				commented after a visit to the region, “respect for human rights has deteriorated at an alarming speed in
				recent months in the context of Turkey's fight against terrorism.”</p>
			<p>However, these comments do not place the conflict into a realm that requires the EU to react. From the quotes
				above, it is clear that the EU has placed the conflict into a human security, or humanitarian, sphere, which
				only requires a diplomatic response from EU officials. As such, Turkey responded diplomatically-and nothing
				more has been said between the two parties regarding the conflict. The EU is unwilling to compromise
				Turkey’s support for dealing with the refugee crisis, and the Turkish government understands this, and knows
				it can act with impunity from the EU. The Turkish government has accumulated vast political capital with the
				EU, and has used that to its advantage in deflecting any real criticism by the EU.</p>
			<p>In summary, the US and the EU face too great a risk when confronting the Kurdish conflict. Both actors are
				heavily invested in different respects in Turkey, and both depend on the support of the Turkish government
				for their security and foreign policy objectives to succeed. Yet both actors have manoeuvred the issue using
				differing methods, in spite of grudging support from the Turkish government. The US military has accepted
				that there are links between Kurdish militant groups and the PKK, and has gone against Turkey’s wishes in
				supporting the Syrian Kurds whilst maintaining silence as per the Turkish-Kurdish campaign. For the EU, it
				cannot risk losing Turkey as an ally, as Turkey is the EU’s bridge to the Middle East. Therefore, it has
				commented on the bare minimum regarding the conflict, and politicised the issue as a humanitarian, not a
				security, threat.</p>
			<p>Ultimately, Turkey has succeeded in both securitising the Kurdish conflict domestically whilst successfully
				desecuritising the conflict to its foreign allies. Turkey’s goal is to quell any sort of Kurdish and PKK
				resistance within its territory, as it views the PKK and the Kurds both as terrorists and illegal
				organisations that threaten Turkey’s society and nationality. As well, the conflict has become a matter of
				convenience for the president, as he was able to turn the conflict into votes for him during the November
				2015 elections. Simultaneously, the Turkish government successfully convinced its allies that the conflict
				was not for their attention. This is due to both the US and the EU needing to maintain Turkey as an ally in
				the Middle East. Whilst this has come with some pushback by both the EU and the US, Turkey has maintained
				its stance and used its political capital as a key ally to fend off serious criticisms. The conflict is
				relatively young, and is part of a larger conflict spanning Syria and Iraq, but nevertheless it is pitting
				allies of the US against each other, and the US is forced to please both actors in order to accomplish its
				goals. As well, the EU is being forced to sit tight and not comment on the matter, as it cannot risk losing
				Turkey in the Syrian refugee crisis. The Kurdish conflict is splitting allegiances and forcing actors to
				prioritise foreign policy over human rights, and is indeed a security threat in the Middle East and European
				region.</p>
