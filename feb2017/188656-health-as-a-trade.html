				Transnational advocacy networks played a crucial role in the acceptance of the right to health as a trade
				concern that takes precedence over intellectual property protections. The development and influence of this
				norm is reflected in international responses to the 1998-2001 South African litigation over access to
				medicines.
			</p>
	
			<span class="quote">
				“[N]o priority should be given to health over intellectual property considerations… ”<br />
				European Commission Directorate General in response to WHO’s Revised Drug Strategy, October 5, 1998
			</span>
	
			<span class="quote">
				“If the industry did seriously think it could reap large rewards from the poor, then presumably it would be
				busy producing medicines for developing country diseases – which everyone here agrees it abjectly fails to
				do… Focus on prices and patents and you miss the real issues… We need to keep new medicines coming on stream
				through the pipeline. I would argue that you don't get that through tinkering with TRIPS. ”
				David Earnshaw, Director of European Government Affairs and Public Policy for SmithKline Beecham, at the
				1999 Amsterdam Conference on Increasing Access to Essential Drugs, November 29, 1999
			</span>
	
			<p>When South Africa amended section 15C of its Medicines and Related Substances Control Act in 1997, its
				healthcare system was dangerously poorly equipped to address the spread of HIV/AIDS. A legacy of the
				apartheid era, the racially bifurcated system made access to medicines highly unequal, with wealthy whites
				left the only demographic able to afford the small, exorbitantly priced stock of antiretroviral drugs (ARVs)
				available, even when the country had one of the highest rates of HIV infection in the world. The South
				African amendment aimed to help the country cope with the growing AIDS crisis by permitting compulsory
				licensing and parallel imports, which allow certain drugs to be manufactured locally and others to be
				imported from the cheapest sources available internationally. This effort to increase access to affordable
				medicines was framed by patent-holding pharmaceutical companies as a theft of their intellectual property
				(herein IP) and a threat to the profits needed to fund future innovation. In February of 1998, the South
				African Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association and 40 international pharmaceutical companies took legal
				action against the South African government in order to have the law repealed on the grounds that it
				violated the South African Constitution and article 27 of the Agreement on Trade-Related Aspects of
				Intellectual Property Rights (TRIPS). Though the plaintiffs initially had the support of their home
				governments, this support was gradually reduced over time as public outrage mounted against the lawsuit,
				directed by the efforts of a transnational advocacy network of NGOs and patient’s rights groups (herein NGO
				network). By April 19, 2001, the pharmaceutical companies terminated their legal action after the steadily
				escalating public relations crisis culminated in protests in 30 cities across the globe. The leaders of the
				NGO network framed their position on the South African case in the context of a new standard in
				international trade, one in which the right to health takes precedence over IP protection. By emphasizing
				the links between the right to health, access to medicines, and drug patents, the NGO network was able to
				frame the South African amendment as supportive of patients, rather than destructive of patents.</p>
			<p>In her work on norm development, Annika Björkdahl indicates that the influence of norms in international
				relations can be determined by examining patterns of behaviour and rhetoric in a given area. In this way,
				the impact of the emergence of the norm of the right to health taking precedence over IP protection can be
				seen reflected in changes to the US response to the case over time. The change in the way the US pursued the
				case against South Africa’s alleged TRIPs violation changed to reflect the emergence and acceptance of the
				right to health as a trade concern that takes precedence over intellectual property protection, and serves
				as a barometer for the norm’s development up to and following the legal battle.</p>
			<p>Before TRIPS, intellectual property disputes were either handled domestically within countries or brought to
				the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO), but these were deemed insufficient by companies who
				believed that WIPO supported developing country policies at their expense, causing them to lose market share
				and profits abroad due to weak IP protections throughout the 1970s and 80s. In the 1980s, a network of
				corporations with an interest in a strong, coherent set of internationally binding IP protections began to
				link IP to fair trade, innovation, and prevention of counterfeiting and piracy, and pushed the US government
				to strengthen its stance against IP violations both domestically and around the world. These efforts
				succeeded in part because many groups and commissions responsible for advising the US government on trade
				issues were headed by the leaders of IP-reliant companies, like the Advisory Committee for Trade
				Negotiations (ACTN), which was chaired by the CEO of Pfizer, and which created a task force on intellectual
				property rights (herein IPRs) that included the leaders of IBM, Merck & Co, and the Motion Picture
				Association. This created greater opportunity for interest groups with IP concerns to gain influence over US
				policy.</p>
			<p>In 1984, the International Intellectual Property Alliance (IIPA) was formed to represent 1,500 IP-reliant
				companies under eight trade associations in lobbying for amendments to the 1974 Trade Act, making the case
				for IP protection as a matter of fairness in international trade, and arguing that the US economy was losing
				billions of dollars to counterfeiting, piracy, and unfair foreign laws. The IIPA, partnering with the
				Pharmaceutical Manufacturers of America, also argued that IP protections were necessary to promote
				innovation sustainably in the future. Throughout the late 1980s, a series of domestic and international
				actions were taken to promote greater IP protection in international trade. Domestically, the US made
				several amendments to Section 301 of its 1974 Trade Act to allow for the US Trade Representative (USTR) to
				impose restrictions on foreign governments whose policies restrict IP protections, and added a “Special 301”
				provision that requires the USTR to identify and report on countries whose policies create inadequate IP
				protection, listing the worst violators as “Priority Foreign Countries” and putting them on watch lists for
				potential sanctions. These changes extended beyond American borders with the inclusion of IP matters on the
				agenda of the Uruguay Round of trade negotiations at the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT),
				which culminated in the inclusion of TRIPS in an annex of the Marrakesh Agreement Establishing the World
				Trade Organization in 1994. The TRIPS Agreement, by establishing common international standards for IP
				protection, facilitated what the US was doing with the 301 mechanism, pressuring countries to repeal
				unfavourable policies in order to improve conditions for US companies operating abroad. The Pharmaceutical
				Research and Manufacturers in America (PhRMA) brought the South African amendment to discussions of
				bilateral trade between the US and South Africa, putting pressure on the American government to take a
				strong stance against parallel importation and other perceived violations of intellectual property rights
				and compelling the US Trade Representative (USTR) to put South Africa on a 301 watch list that made the
				country easier to sanction. Further, in October of 1998, a law was passed in the US that conditioned
				development assistance on whether steps were being taken to repeal the Amendment act.</p>
			<p>In his work on the influence of norms on state behaviour, Audie Klotz highlights the role of non-state actors
				and transnational movements in driving norm development. The spread of HIV/AIDS was an experience shared
				across the world, and access to antiretroviral drugs (ARVs) to treat the disease was central to the
				transnational movement that brought an end to the South African suit, resonating with the concerns of AIDS
				patients and their advocates everywhere. The NGO-led transnational advocacy network against the South
				African case founded their opposition to the suit on the right to health, which necessitates access to
				essential medicines. The NGO network leveraged this existing norm’s relevance in the South African case and
				linked the right to health to TRIPS implementation in their campaign. In South Africa, local groups
				established the Treatment Action Campaign (TAC), who attended the case as an amicus curia to frame the suit
				as a matter of profits being put before people while raising awareness publicly. Abroad, MSF/Doctors without
				Borders led the Access Campaign, a multinational coalition that lobbied for the suit, as well as drug
				prices, to be dropped. By connecting with relevant authorities, running public education initiatives, and
				making appeals to the existing normative framework, activist groups were able to effectively challenge the
				position of the pharmaceutical companies and generate support for the supremacy of the right to health over
				IP concerns.</p>
			<p>Activists appealed to the existing normative framework, which included the right to health as embodied in
				Article 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, and drew connections between the right to health
				and trade-related aspects of IP in the context of access to AIDS medications in the South African case. The
				South African amendment, which was first framed in terms of a theft of property and a barrier to innovation,
				would be framed as a matter of human equality and the right to health, norms that fit tightly within the
				existing normative framework in the US and the international community. The NGO network loosened support for
				the suit by framing the position of the pharmaceutical companies as being based on greed, as opposed to
				support for future innovations. The NGO network weakened the case for patents being the “lifeblood ” of the
				pharmaceutical industry by seeking out information regarding whether or not it was truly feasible to reduce
				the price of drugs, concluding that much of the USD 10,000 price tag attached to a year’s supply of HIV/AIDS
				medicines was unnecessary mark-up, as evidenced by Cipla, an Indian drug manufacturer that was willing to
				offer the same treatment for just USD 350.</p>
			<p>Alongside efforts to undermine the pharmaceutical manufacturers’ case through fact-finding, the NGO network
				made use of its resources, including its high-profile members such as Ralph Nader, to get the attention of
				relevant authorities. In 1998, the leading NGOs in the network attended World Health Assembly (WHA), where
				they introduced some of their normative ideas, with the WHA quickly passing a new resolution supporting the
				idea that trade agreements should not threaten equitable access to medications. This validated the new norm
				and gave the network authority to spread it further. The 2000 American presidential elections also offered
				an opportunity to raise the profile of the access to medicines issue in US policy. Al Gore, who began his
				presidential campaign with a negative stance on the Amendment Act and the hope of winning campaign
				contributions from PhRMA, had a number of his campaign appearances visited by noisy protesters bearing
				slogans such as “Gore is killing Africans – AIDS drugs now. ” Soon after, Gore sent a letter to the Black
				Congressional Caucus indicating that a change of policy was in order, and that he supported the South
				African Amendment Act.</p>
			<p>The NGO network also staged numerous public events and conferences, including one in Amsterdam in 1999 to
				parallel the WTO’s Seattle ministerial meeting, which attracted activists and lobbyists from 50 countries,
				and produced a public statement that called for greater consideration of the impact of trade policies on
				health in developing countries, and for a working group to be established in the WTO to address TRIPS and
				access to medicines. Over time, the network won further support from the World Health Organization (WHO),
				who brought together the WHA to discuss a revised drug strategy in May of 1999. Upon learning about the
				possibility of a revised drug strategy paving the way for future weakening of patent protections, the US
				sent not health policy experts, but trade negotiators to the discussions. The NGO network predicted that
				this would happen, and met in advance to prepare their own negotiators to deliberate, bringing in evidence
				of compulsory licensing practices within the US that made the USTR’s position seem hypocritical. On March 5,
				2001, TAC led an international day of action against pharmaceutical profiteering which was joined by protest
				groups in a dozen countries. On March 8, MSF began circling an international petition calling on the
				plaintiffs to drop the suit. The petition garnered 250,000 signatures in a little over a month as MSF
				persuaded the EU, Dutch, German, and French governments to withdraw support for the suit and call for it to
				be dropped. Throughout, the WHO helped provide legal assistance to aid South Africa’s defense, and Nelson
				Mandela’s criticisms of the plaintiffs made world news.</p>
			<p>Throughout 1999, the US government removed South Africa from its watch lists and stopped pressures to repeal
				the amendment, while South Africa in turn assured the USTR that it would implement Section 15C in accordance
				with what was permitted by TRIPS. In the same year, South Africa was removed from the Special 301 watch
				list, and at the WTO Ministerial in Seattle, President Bill Clinton publicly announced plans to change US
				policy to improve access to AIDS medications in Africa, along with plans for the USTR to work more closely
				with the Department of Health and Human Services to ensure that US IP policy would become “flexible enough
				to respond to legitimate public health crises.” Soon after, in May 2000, Clinton issued executive order
				13155, which prohibited the US from seeking “through negotiation or otherwise, the revocation of any
				intellectual property law or policy of a beneficiary sub-Saharan African country, as determines by the
				President, that regulates HIV/AIDS pharmaceuticals or medical technologies.” This represents a complete
				reversal of the US’s stance on the South African case and is indicative of a response to the normative
				pressures leveraged by the NGO network and the widespread public support it had gained for its cause.</p>
			<p>After all this, the pharmaceutical companies capitulated, agreeing to end the suit and cover South Africa’s
				legal expenses. Leading up to the withdrawal, the CEO of GlaxoSmithKline met with UN Secretary General Kofi
				Annan to help broker a deal with the President of South Africa on behalf of the pharmaceutical group, with
				the EU and WHO firmly supporting South Africa. With South African agreement to ensure TRIPS compliance
				moving forward, the lawsuit was dropped and AIDS activists celebrated the success of their efforts to frame
				the conflict as a matter of corporate greed impinging on the right to health for the poor.</p>
			<p>Throughout the proceedings, the norm of the right to health taking precedence over intellectual property
				protection had emerged and been developed to reach a critical mass of support internationally. The NGO
				network used a variety of means to create pressures from above, such as those created by WHA validation, and
				pressures from below, in the form of public protest and lobbying, which, given widespread support for the
				norm, reversed the US’s stance on the issue, bringing the norm to its tipping point into acceptance.
				According to the reflections of the 2004 president of the International Federation of Pharmaceutical
				Manufacturers and Associations on the reputation of the pharmaceutical industry, the AIDS epidemic was
				accompanied by the first conflict in which organized groups of patients and their supporters confronted
				companies about how much they would be allowed to charge for medications. This normative victory is
				reflected well in the provisions for global health and HIV/AIDS medicines in the Doha Declaration, which
				links the right to health to intellectual property and international trade, granting WTO members the right
				to grant compulsory licenses, permission to allow parallel imports, and the freedom to determine what
				constitutes a public health emergency that would justify making use of TRIPS flexibility . The TRIPS
				agreement’s Article 30 permitted compulsory licensing in emergencies, but it was only after the Doha
				Ministerial in 2001 that public health crises were explicitly included as a national emergency that
				warranted Article 30 protection. The acceptance of the right to health as an issue that warrants a place at
				the table in trade negotiations was explicit at Doha, which represented the institutionalization of the norm
				of the precedence of health over IP concerns, indicating that never again would violators be able to take
				for granted the unqualified support of their home government or of the WTO where their IP interests clashed
				with the health needs of a population.</p>
