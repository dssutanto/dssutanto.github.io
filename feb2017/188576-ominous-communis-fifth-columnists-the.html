			<p>On March 26, 1947, in a testimony before the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC), FBI Director J.
				Edgar Hoover laid out the prevalent world-view towards American communism. In the testimony, Hoover asserted
				that, “The Communist movement in the United States… stands for the destruction of our American form of
				government; it stands for the destruction of American democracy; it stands for the destruction of free
				enterprise; and it stands for the creation of a ‘Soviet of the United States’ and ultimate world
				revolution”. Hoover was not alone in having these views. The supposedly unprecedented danger that Communism
				posed to the American way of life became a mania that percolated throughout the whole society. This paranoia
				formed the period known as the ‘Second Red Scare’ of late 1940s until the middle 1950's. The Communist
				‘witch hunt’ targeted all levels of the United States from the local schoolteacher to the highest reaches of
				the American government. The drive to root out not just the minuscule number of Soviet spies, but also the
				much larger Communist Party and its sympathizers, was far from spontaneous. Anti-Communism pervaded much of
				the American public at this time, spearheaded especially by a loose coalition of politicians, businesses,
				religious and patriotic orders, and investigation agencies. This undercurrent, combined with unsettling
				international events, allowed the Second Red Scare to explode into the spotlight. The emergence and
				perpetuation of the Red Scare was a result of the long-standing anti-Communist sentiment in America taking
				advantage of the setbacks in the early years of the Cold War.</p>
			<p>The Second Red Scare represented the culmination of a decades-long backlash against groups, people, and ideas
				that were seen as un-American. It was a reaction to the twentieth century that had – up to that point – been
				incredibly destabilizing for the United States. At the opening of the century, the nation seemed on the
				brink of insurrection, with radical leaders like Luigi Galleani leading the Anarchist charge against the
				American political and economic system. The 1901 assassination of President McKinley was the first in a
				series of killings and bombings by Anarchists during the period. The 1917 Russian Revolution highlighted the
				danger that a small cadre of disciplined radicals could pose to the established order, a fact that critics
				of Anarchism, and later Communism, would not miss. The terrible general strikes and race riots of 1919
				seemed to signal, in the minds of many conservative Americans, an attempted Bolshevik coup in the United
				States. Although the prophesized 1920 May Day Revolution failed to materialize and the Palmer Raids showed
				themselves to be superfluous, anti-Communism was not significantly set back. In fact, the events of
				1919-1920 not only focused public attention on the Communist threat, but also allowed leading
				anti-Communists to begin to widen the scope of potential ‘subversives’ past the stereotypical ‘bomb-throwing
				Anarchists’ to other groups and individuals. When the Second Red Scare emerged in the late 1940's, they
				would be the new targets.</p>
			<p>The first of these groups were the country’s labour unions. The general strikes of 1919 hailed an emergence
				of radical unions in America. The International Workers of the World, formed in 1905, was joined by various
				Communist-led unions during the 1920's and 30's. The conservative labour community responded by denouncing
				these organizations. In 1934, American Federation of Labour (AFL) president, William Green, contended that
				Communism’s mission was to co-opt labour unions and create “a revolutionary organization to overthrow
				American economic and political institutions”. The public mood and the rank-and-file of the major unions
				tolerated suspected Communists during the 1930's, but as anti-Communism reemerged after the Second World
				War, the toleration dried up. In an effort to get out in front of the Communist issue, the AFL and its
				rival, the Congress of Industrial Organization (CIO) took draconian steps to purge their organizations of
				alleged Communists. The CIO realigned its traditional radical leftist worldview towards vehemently opposing
				the Soviets on the world stage and Communists within its own ranks. The Taft-Hartley Act, which had so
				diminished the power of the unions, was appropriated by them to use against their Communist members. The CIO
				went further in proving its anti-Communist credentials by ousting several allegedly Communist-led unions
				from its membership. The story of anti-Communism and American unions serve to show how the tenor of the
				times forced even the left-leaning segments of the population to become accomplices of the Red Scare furore.
			</p>
			<p>The backlash against American Communists was not restricted to the unions. To complement President Truman’s
				loyalty program, the Attorney General created a list of organizations that were deemed subversive,
				Communistic, or advocated unconstitutional change of the American political system. The list – expanded from
				93 to 197 organizations between 1847 and 1950 – included youth leagues; ethnic and religious groups; civil
				rights organizations; Socialist, Communist, or Fascist parties; and radical labour unions. J. Edgar Hoover
				argued that Communists infiltrated hundreds of organizations for “the promotion of Soviet war and peace
				aims, the exploitation of Negroes in the United States, work among foreign-language, and to secure a
				favourable viewpoint towards the Communists in domestic, political, social, and economic issues”. To those
				who believed what Hoover was saying, it would have seemed as if a great number of groups were secretly
				subverting the American way of life. Senator Joseph McCarthy epitomized the feeling in his 1950 Wheeling
				speech by reminding his audience that, “we are not dealing with spies who get thirty pieces of silver to
				steal the blueprints of a new weapon”. In effect, the ‘War on Communism’ was not simply against paid spies
				from Moscow, but also against the threat from Americans who would attempt to nudge American public opinion
				and policy to the advantage of Communists and the Soviet Union. The Hollywood blacklist provides an example
				of how the sliding definition of a threat came to be applied to individuals who were suspected, not
				necessarily of advocating the overthrow of the American government, but of belonging to the Communist Party
				or of presumed sister organizations. The Hollywood Ten were famous for refusing to admit or deny belonging
				to such a group; as a result, they were cited in contempt of Congress and were blacklisted from the film
				industry. These and other examples show the all-encompassing nature of the Second Red Scare. Traditional
				opponents of the scare-mongering became willing accomplices in an attempt to shield themselves from charges
				of Communist sympathies.</p>
			<p>The anti-Communist paranoia was often stoked by groups and individuals who had a vested interest in the
				issue. Some of the most vocal anti-Communists, for example, were Catholics. Soviet persecution of Catholics
				in Eastern Europe pushed the Church to become bitterly hostile to anyone who seemed sympathetic to the
				Soviet cause. The American Legion, a veterans group founded in the aftermath of the First World War, was
				also a persistent foe of American Communism. They sought to inform the public about the Communist menace and
				to promote patriotism and Americanism as the best defence against subversion. Many organizations took it
				upon themselves to root out Communists, often as a means to deflect criticism from hard-line
				anti-Communists. Hollywood and labour unions have previously been mentioned, but schools, legal
				institutions, and the government itself were all fixated on purging themselves of any suspected Communists.
			</p>
			<p>When President Truman vetoed the McCarran Internal Security Bill, he called it “a mockery of the Bill of
				Rights” and “a long step towards totalitarianism” The veto was overturned by a huge margin. How was it that
				the President of the United States was not able to prevent the passage of such a reactionary bill? The
				domestic factors examined above only provide part of the answer. The anti-Communist sentiment and the
				network of anti-Communist groups and accomplices set the stage for the Second Red Scare, but it alone could
				not spark the nation-wide paranoia of the period. The Cold War developments, and the subsequent security
				panic was just the spark that was needed.</p>
			<p>The first of these events occurred in 1949, along the steppes on modern-day Kazakhstan, with the detonation
				of RDS-1, the Soviet Union’s first atomic bomb. The news of the test sent shockwaves throughout the United
				States. The American public had been conditioned to view the Soviets as technologically backwards and
				incapable of producing an atomic weapon until the early or middle 1950's. It was clear that they had
				received information from ‘Atomic Spies’ involved in the Manhattan Project. The most prominent spy picked up
				by United States intelligence services was Julius Rosenberg and his wife, Ethel Rosenberg. The severity of
				the betrayal was clear. Judge Irving Kaufman, who would hand down the death sentence to the Rosenbergs,
				stated, “We must realize that we are dealing with a missile of destruction which can wipe out millions of
				Americans”. He further condemned them, stating, “I consider your crime worse than murder”. The unprecedented
				fear of nuclear war – a scenario only possible due to the actions of individuals like the Rosenbergs –
				raised the stakes of failing to stop Communist infiltration.</p>
			<p>Likely the most famous (or infamous) aspect of the Second Red Scare relates to the investigation of Communist
				influence within the government of the United States. Prior to 1949, there had been occasional
				investigations and hearings into potential Communist influences within the government, particularly the
				State Department. The most famous of such cases was that of Alger Hiss, a liberal assistant to the Assistant
				Secretary of State who was charged for espionage and convicted of perjury. The government investigations
				would hit their stride following news that China had fallen to the Communist forces of Mao Zedong. The
				shocking collapse of the Nationalist forces under Chiang Kai-shek opened the government up to scrutiny about
				harbouring Communists; conservative politicians were loath to admit that Chiang’s corrupt and inept
				administration was responsible for the revolution. The so-called ‘China Lobby’ attacked the Truman
				administration for supposedly harbouring Communist sympathizers, like John Stewart Service and Owen
				Lattimore, in the State Department. Indeed, the two men in question had written scathing attacks on Chiang’s
				government while stationed in the Far East during the war. Service was accused of handing sensitive
				documents concerning Far Eastern policy to the Pro-Communist China journal <i>Amerasia</i> but was not
				convicted. The failure to clamp down on Service proved, in the minds of Joseph McCarthy and his ilk, were
				‘soft on Communism’. McCarthy used Service’s activities to propel himself into the political spotlight,
				which also put the Truman administration and Democrats on the defensive. These charges forced many liberals
				unwillingly to join the anti-Communist coalition, in the hopes of not being accused, themselves, of
				harbouring Communist sympathies.</p>
			<p>The final ingredient to create the Red Scare mania was the Korean War. The Korean War silenced much of the
				opposition to the anti-Communist crusade. Typical wartime measures to limit freedom of speech were employed
				regularly. The Alien Registration Act of 1940, for example, was revived and used against leaders of the
				Communist Party to great effect. Author of the majority opinion, Chief Justice Fred Vinson, noted that
				“Certainly an attempt to overthrow the Government by force, even though doomed from the outset…is a
				sufficient evil for Congress to prevent”. He went on to state, “It is the existence of the conspiracy which
				creates the danger... If the ingredients of the reaction are present, we cannot bind the government to wait
				until the catalyst is added”. The Chief Justice was saying that, in times such as those in which he lived,
				the threat of violent revolution was enough to warrant repression. He was not alone in his opinion. The
				wartime fever had infected the whole country, giving the Second Red Scare exactly what it needed to
				perpetuate itself.</p>
			<p>The anti-Communist feeling of twentieth century America, combined with early Cold War developments, allowed
				for the development and propagation of the fear and paranoia of the Second Red Scare. The legacy of America
				anti-Communism en-compassed a broad mania of radical and subversive groups. Labour unions and other leftist
				groups were targeted, forcing them to become complicit in the acts by purging their ranks of alleged
				Communists. A broad coalition of anti-Communists were instrumental in pressuring organizations to take a
				tough-er stand against the supposed threat. The catalyst for many of the worst abuses came as a result of
				the ramping up of the Cold War. The detonation of the first Soviet nuclear weapon produced a furore over
				atomic spies. The Chinese Communist Revolution created a panic regarding Communist infiltration of the State
				Department specifically, and the government more generally. Finally, the Korean War provided the
				McCarthyites with the patriotic cover to advocate for a quashing of dissent. The measures that ended up
				being employed against subversives in the United States may have been largely hysterical, but the mood of
				the period more than warranted that overreaction.</p>
