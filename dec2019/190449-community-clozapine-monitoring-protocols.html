			<h2>Abstract</h2>

			<p>
				Clozapine is a crucial antipsychotic medication to treat schizophrenia and has shown valuable benefits
				in doing so. However, there can be rare, but potentially fatal adverse drug reactions to the medication.
				Therefore, it is essential that there is careful monitoring of the patient while on the medication. A
				retrospective study was conducted to examine the effects of clozapine on vitals during the first 2 days
				of initiation. There were 43 (29 male, 16 female) charts analyzed retrospectively, and the average age
				of the patients was 45 years old. The average dose of clozapine on the first day was 9.3mg and 15.7mg on
				the second day. Regarding vitals, the temperature peaked 5 hours after administrating clozapine on day 1
				and day 2. Furthermore, the respiration rate peaked 4 hours post-dose on the second day and the heart
				rate increased the most on the second day indicating a dose-related response. There was no trend in
				blood pressure changes that can be inferred from the data; however, individual variations in blood
				pressure fluctuated considerably. The study was limited due to a lack of data in patient charts, and it
				may be of interest to do a prospective study to gain more insight.
			</p>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>

			<p>Clozapine is a unique, atypical antipsychotic medication that is effective for treating the positive and
				negative symptoms of schizophrenia (McEvoy et al., 2006). However, it may cause severe side effects such
				as agranulocytosis, seizures, cardiovascular/respiratory arrest and myocarditis (Merrill et al. 2006;
				Miller 2000). In fact, approximately 8.1% of patients are taken off therapy due to a serious side effect
				(Grohmann, 1989). There are significant side effects with treatment, and it is essential to treat
				schizophrenia effectively as it is a severe mental disorder that can cause considerable disability such
				as delusions, hallucinations, problems with concentration, and a lack of motivation among other
				debilitating aspects.</p>
			<p>This study aimed to determine the effects of clozapine on patient’s vitals during the first two days of
				dosage titration and if there is an appropriate amount of monitoring while at a community initiation of
				therapy. Currently at the Fraser Health Psychosis Treatment Optimizing program (PTOP), patients starting
				clozapine have their blood pressure (standing and lying), temperature, pulse, and respiration measured
				before dosage administration, 15 minutes, one hour, two hours, three hours, four hours, five hours and
				six hours post-dose for the first two days of therapy (Fraser Health Authority, 2015). Such intense
				monitoring can make it difficult for providers to follow and increases the amount of laborious
				monitoring towards the patient.</p>
			<p>Although there are significant and life-threatening side effects associated with clozapine, there are no
				evidence-based monitoring plans (Canadian Agency for Drugs and Technologies in Health, 2010).
				Furthermore, monitoring guidelines across the world were examined to determine if a trend could be
				found. The Commonwealth regions (New Zealand, Australia, Wales, Manchester) and California were
				investigated and found no consistent monitoring patterns between the regions.</p>
			<p>When the health authorities were contacted for the rationale behind the guidelines they described it as
				being based on drug monographs and Maudsley’s prescribing guidelines (11th edition). When examining the
				Maudsley’s recommendation, it suggests to either give the first dose in the morning and monitor for 3
				hours or give the first dose in the evening before retiring to avoid monitoring (Taylor et al., 2015).
				The drug monograph recommendations are based on an expert panel review board and are very similar to
				Maudsley’s monitoring proposals (O’Brien 2004, and. Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2003). Thus, the current
				drug monitoring guidelines within the Fraser Health Authority significantly err on the safer side when
				compared to other literature sources of clozapine monitoring.</p>
			<h2>Methods</h2>

			<p>Between the period of 2012-2015, a retrospective review of PTOP clozapine therapy initiation within the
				Fraser Health was examined for vital sign data (blood pressure, respiration rate, heart rate and
				temperature). The study searched for any changes in blood pressure and heart rate at each of the current
				monitoring intervals; the monitoring levels are attained at baseline 15 minutes, one hour, two hours,
				three hours, four hours, five hours and six hours post-dose for the first two days of therapy).
				Furthermore, demographic information for confounding was also examined such as medication, age,
				comorbidities, sex, prior exposure to clozapine, blood work, and ECG monitoring.</p>
			<p>All data were examined for means, standard deviations, and missing information. Furthermore, data
				collection was analysed for consistency in recording of data, clinician accuracy and discrepancies. In
				addition, bias was also examined such as in areas of selection, design, response, reporting, and
				measurement. Starting dose clozapine was also evaluated. The primary objective of this study was to
				determine any changes in vital signs associated with clozapine initiation in the first two days and the
				time of peak effect. The secondary goal was to determine if there are patient factors (e.g. age, gender,
				ethnicity, number or type of concurrent medications) that are associated with any observed changes in
				vital signs.</p>
			<h2>Results</h2>

			<h3>Demographics</h3>
			<p>
				There were 174 patients made up PTOP, but n = 131 were excluded, leaving 43 charts to examine in this
				study. The patients were excluded due to a lack of patient monitoring information. There were 29 male
				and 16 female patients, and the average age was 45 years old. The mean dose on the first day was 9.3mg
				and the average treatment dose on the second day was 15.7mg. All available past substance and medication
				history were collected (Table 1 and 2). Table 3 shows pre-existing risk factors and comorbidities of the
				patient. It is important to note that due to the nature of data collection Tables 1, 2, and 3 are
				anticipated to be incomplete (retrospective study).
			</p>
			<h3>Temperature</h3>
			<p>
				Temperature peaked at 5 hours post-dose for both days 1 and 2. The maximum temperature for a patient was
				37.6˚C, and the minimum was 34.1˚C with a standard deviation of 0.60. Refer to Figure 1 for the graph of
				temperature.

			</figure>
			<h3>Respiration</h3>
			<p>
				The maximum respiration rate recorded was 30 breaths/minute, and the lowest was 10 breaths/minute. The
				standard deviation is 2.5. The respiration for Day 2 spikes at the 4th hour, 19 breaths/minute, and
				appears slightly higher than the first day. Refer to Figure 2.

				<figcaption>Fig. 2: average respiration rate at each vital monitoring time (n = 43)</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<h3>Heart rate</h3>
			<p>
				Figure 3 shows the maximum heart rate was 121 beats per minute (bpm) and the minimum was 49 bpm. The
				lying heart rate standard deviation for the patient population is 13.9 bpm. The peak in pulse appears to
				occur between hours 3.5-5.5. The second day seems to have a more significant increase in heart rate
				compared to the first day. Figure 4 shows the maximum average heart rate change from lying to standing
				and occurs at hour 3 in Day 1, 17.1 bpm, and the lowest average change occurs at hour 2 in Day 1 (8.4).
				The standard deviation of the averaged data is 2.5. The maximum individual change occurred was 53 bpm,
				and the lowest was – 11 bpm (decreased by 11 bpm from lying to standing). The number of patients
				consisting of these values had a low statistical power and the number of patient data at each time
				interval ranged from 11 to 6. Thus, examining the lying to standing changes may be difficult to make a
				definitive conclusion as the data is insufficient.

			</figure>
			<h3>Blood pressure</h3>
			<p>
				Challenges exist in the measurement of blood pressure, as the values can range depending on the
				practitioner technique (i.e. manual vs automatic) and the device itself (Mansoor et al. 2016). When
				examining for a trend in blood pressure changes, there did not appear to be a large difference. However,
				the averages oversimplify the differences for each patient. The individual changes ranged from an
				increase of 37 mmHg to a decrease of 39 mmHg when measuring blood pressure from a lying to standing
				position; Table 4 displays the variance for individual patients.
			</p>
			<h2>Discussion</h2>

			<p>The study took data from sites that were following guidelines implemented prior to August 2016 and
				examined available patient charts for monitoring data. Temperature, respiration rate, and pulse have a
				distinct peak centred around 4 hours with a range of 3-6 hours. The temperature did not rise above 38˚C
				in any of the patients (n = 43) between pre-dose and six hours post-dose (for days 1 and 2). Heart rate
				and the temperature had a greater increase on the second day. It is important to monitor temperature as
				fever is a risk factor for agranulocytosis and Neuroleptic Malignant Syndrome (NMS) (Novartis
				Pharmaceuticals, 2010; Young et al., 1998). Temperature elevation (&gt;38˚C) is associated to have a
				peak incidence within the first three weeks of treatment. However, it is usually benign and
				self-limiting (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2010; Young et al., 1998). Therefore, elevation of temperature
				is not a good reason to stop therapy when examining just that parameter (O’Brien, 2004).</p>
			<p>The effect of clozapine on heart rate elevation is that it may be a risk factor for myocarditis and
				cardiomyopathy (Safferman et al., 1991). However, the reports of myocarditis are rare and tachycardia
				(bpm &gt; 100) occurs in 25% of all patient (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, 2010). Most commonly, monitoring
				heart rate is used to assess compliance and mild elevations of pulse is not significant enough to
				discontinue therapy (O’Brien, 2004). However, when the heart rate increases 30 beats per minute from
				baseline it may be a significant health concern.</p>
			<p>When examining the average respiratory rate, the rate did not increase by more than one breath/minute in
				day 1 or day 2. When monitoring breathing rate, the primary concern is oversedation and respiratory
				collapse (O’Brien, 2004). However, it is rare to occur but, should be monitored closely when
				benzodiazepines are involved or other central nervous system depressants (Novartis Pharmaceuticals,
				2010).</p>
			<p>Blood pressure monitoring is the most significant vital to measure during clozapine initiation.
				Orthostatic hypotension has a 9% incidence and is dose-related (Marinkovic et al 1994; Safferman et al.,
				1991). Also, orthostatic hypotension is most likely to occur during the initial dose titration
				(California Correctional Health Care Services, 2017). Approximately 1 in 3000 patients experience
				collapse and respiratory or cardiac arrest when on clozapine (Young et al., 1998). The most significant
				blood pressure change occurred on the second day (dose dependent). For example, the blood pressure
				changes ranged from an increase of 39mmHg to a decrease of 39 mmHg. Thus, blood pressure varied quite
				considerably and averaged data can oversimplify these changes. It may be a health concern when the blood
				pressure deviates greater than 20 mmHg from baseline. Due to the high incidence of orthostatic
				hypertension and considerable blood pressure fluctuations, it is of particular importance to measure
				blood pressure over any other parameter during the first two days of a clozapine start.</p>
			<p>Heart rate also had the most change on the second day (dose-dependent) and occurred between 3.5-5.5
				hours. The pulse was noted to increase steadily after administering clozapine. However, there was not
				enough data to show a statistical difference.</p>
			<p>There are several limitations to this study that should be considered. Due to an under recording of vital
				sign data and lack of complete health practitioner charts, there is a shortfall of information. It may
				be of interest to do a prospective study to gain further insight prior to implementing any
				recommendation. Only ~1/4 of charts contained some form of vitals monitoring data. The charts used had
				incomplete vital recordings and patient background, and thus, there is likely to be bias in the data
				(only certain nurses recorded and properly filed the vital sign data). Furthermore, there was weak
				statistical power in the study (n = 43).</p>
