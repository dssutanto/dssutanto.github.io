                Submission criteria and process
            </h2>
            <h3>Schedule and types of submission</h3>
            <p>We accept submissions on a rolling basis throughout the year. Every fortnight, we publish manuscripts and
                culminate them into an issue at the end of the semester term.</p>

            <p>Due to the volume of submissions we receive, there is no guarantee that your submission will be
                considered for the forthcoming issue. As we process submissions in the order received, your submission
                might
                instead be considered for the following issue.</p>

            <p>We accept primary research articles as well literature reviews from all academic disciplines including
                the
                natural and social sciences, humanities, commerce, and engineering.</p>

            <h3>Submission criteria</h3>

            <p>Articles submitted to CJUR cannot have been previously published or accepted to an additional
                peer-reviewed
                journal or book (print or electronic). By submitting an article to CJUR, the author must acknowledge
                that the material
                is not also currently under review at another publication and that the material will not be submitted to
                another journal until the editorial board of CJUR has reached a decision. CJUR does accept articles from
                coursework but this
                must be disclosed at the time of submission. Written acknowledgements must also be made to the
                institution
                and course for which it was originally intended, and the author must confirm that the article has
                already been
                graded prior to submission.</p>

            <div class="caution">You must <a href="https://ojs.library.ubc.ca/index.php/cjur">register</a> to OJS in order to make a submission</div>

            <h3>Making a submission</h3>
            <p>To submit to CJUR, simply register as an author on our online submission system to submit your article.
            </p>

            <h2>Editorial process</h2>
            <p>
                Our editorial board consists of undergraduate students who screen the submissions to be considered for
                publication for adherence to guidelines and general fitness within the journal. Submissions are then
                reviewed by
                1-2 faculty or graduate students who evaluate the quality and rigour of the article before they are
                accepted for publication in CJUR. Following review, the reviewer(s) and editorial board will declare
                each
                submission as being either: “accepted”, “accepted with minor revisions” or “resubmit for review.” Those
                whose submissions require minor
                revisions will have 2-3 weeks to return their submission with the appropriate amendments prior to
                publication.
