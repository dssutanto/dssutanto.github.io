                                The objective of this research is to investigate Canadian criminal
                                judges’ views on offences related to procuring, seeking, or controlling under-aged sex
                                workers, and factors influencing sentence severity. A qualitative analysis was conducted
                                on sentencing court reports in Canada obtained through the Canadian Legal Information
                                Institute (CanLII) database. Twelve sentencing court reports that fit the criteria of
                                inclusion
                                were selected as samples. Data analysis and coding procedures were guided by theories
                                put
                                forth by Amirault and Beauregard (2014), and Kingsnorth, MacIntosh, and Wentworth
                                (1999), in
                                combination with a grounded theory approach. Results revealed that mitigating and
                                aggravating factors, and existing provisions in the Criminal Code of Canada were the
                                main factors influencing judges’ decisions on sentence severity. Furthermore, judges
                                viewed
                                these offences as inherently wrong, and attributed culpability entirely on the offender
                                by
                                referring to under-aged sex workers as vulnerable victims, and chastising offenders by
                                referring to their behaviours as selfish and disgusting. Implications in relation to
                                current societal views on sex-workers were discussed, and strategies for future research
                                were
                                suggested.

                                The objective of this study was to determine the economic factors and
                                characteristics of universal healthcare development among Brazil, Russia, India and
                                China (BRIC). A policy review was used to achieve this objective. This review established a
                                comparative criterion of the key factors and characteristics of universal healthcare
                                coverage development. Further, a comparison of three countries with established
                                universal healthcare coverage, comprising of tax-based and social insurance models, was undertaken
                                against BRIC healthcare systems. The decided upon factors and characteristics of
                                developing and BRIC countries were used to inform and understand the development of process of
                                universal healthcare coverage. The analysis found that continual economic growth and
                                investment into the healthcare coverage are essential to successful universal healthcare
                                coverage implementation and expansion. Understanding the models of healthcare systems
                                along with the key economic factors and characteristics provides important context and
                                understanding into the processes and mechanisms that drive successful universal
                                healthcare coverage in developing countries. The factors and characteristics presented in this
                                study provide a preliminary framework for understanding the conditions that contribute to
                                universal healthcare coverage. This framework can be used as a template for a critical
                                comparison and analysis that can be applied to all high, middle- and low-income
                                countries in their effort to establish universal healthcare coverage.

                            The scarcity of iron in marine environments, particularly in the Southern
                            Ocean, provides ideal experimental grounds for large-scale iron fertilization. The Iron
                            Hypothesis, proposed in the 1980s, sparked a series of in-situ fertilization experiments in
                            the HNLC waters of the Southern Ocean aiming to prove that the addition of Fe(II) to
                            iron-deficient phytoplankton populations would enhance photosynthetic processes to the point where they
                            could serve as a viable method of mitigating anthropogenic carbon emissions through the
                            acceleration of oceanic carbon sequestration. By examining the mechanisms behind iron fertilization, as
                            well as contributions to the field and the gaps in knowledge pertaining to three major iron
                            fertilization experiments – SOIREE, SOFeX, and LOHAFEX – this review will provide a
                            comprehensive overview of the past, present, and future of iron fertilization.

                            This study centres on the 2015 “Millennium Development Goals,” (MDGs) a
                            historic United Nations (UN) initiative aimed at bridging many of the world’s inequalities.
                            Since its conclusion, the success of the project has been hotly debated, as progress at the
                            international level was markedly uneven. In order to ensure the success of future
                            initiatives, it is necessary to determine why these goals failed so decisively in some contexts but
                            succeeded in others. Given the innumerable nations involved in the project, the scope of the essay was
                            narrowed to focus on a single country and MDG goal. This study centers on the improbable
                            attainment of the fourth development goal (pertaining to neonatal and newborn health) in
                            Bangladesh, one of the world’s poorest countries. Using official UN documents, seminal
                            literature, and consultation with crucial UN actor Uzma Syed herself, this study
                            demonstrates that Bangladesh’s success was a result of efficient programming, data acquisition, and
                            transnational, individual, and domestic cooperation. This allowed a small nation like
                            Bangladesh to significantly reduce its under-five and infant mortality rates, illustrating that it is,
                            in fact, possible to enact meaningful change in difficult circumstances. Following the
                            conclusion of the initiative, the country has decided to maintain child survival as a government health
                            priority, as inequalities between populations persist. According to former secretary general
                            Ban Ki-Moon, a continued, strategic focus on under-fives is imperative, with a particular
                            emphasis on the structural and social determinants of health. Looking, now, toward the Sustainable
                            Development Goals (SDGs), Bangladesh’s triumph can be used to build a framework for
                            continued progress in the realms of child and neonatal health.

                            Artificial hearts are designed to eliminate the need for heart transplants,
                            which are in short supply. However, these devices are prone to creating complications such
                            as infections or strokes. The complications occur from the mechanical aspects of the device.
                            Therefore, the devices’ effectiveness is influenced by their design. This paper investigates
                            the advances in technology of different artificial hearts that are being developed. The four
                            devices evaluated in this paper are: the total artificial heart, the left ventricular assist device,
                            the total internal artificial heart, and the HeartWare ventricular assist device. Research shows
                            that the total artificial heart may result in both infections and strokes. The left
                            ventricular assist device lowered the probability of these complications but did not eliminate the risk
                            altogether. While the internal artificial heart was able to eliminate the risk of infections
                            entirely, it introduced new complications. Finally, the HeartWare ventricular assist device
                            decreased the rate of adverse events for the complications occurring over time. Given these
                            results, artificial hearts still require further research to improve the risk of
                            complication before the phasing out of heart transplants can occur.

                            Alzheimer’s disease, a progressive neurodegenerative disorder, is the most
                            pervasive form of dementia worldwide. Impairment in face processing is a common trait of the
                            disorder, causing a deficit not only in the processing of emotional expressions, but also
                            causing a deficit in face recognition. Research into the causes of impaired face recognition
                            in Alzheimer’s disease patients has found several factors at play: Abnormal temporal lobe
                            activation in response to familiar faces, a breakdown in holistic processing of faces due to
                            changes in frontal lobe activation, and atrophy of areas of the brain implicated in theory
                            of mind. These neural changes are evident long prior to any alterations of behavior. Due to the
                            progressive nature of Alzheimer’s disease, patients display increasing levels of impairment
                            in face recognition over time. At the final stages of the disorder, patients lose all ability
                            to recognize familiar faces, and most strikingly, lose the ability to self-recognize. Further
                            research on face recognition in Alzheimer’s disease may improve our knowledge both in
                            neurotypical face recognition, as well as aid in discovering novel ways of helping patients
                            cope with their symptoms.

                            Historical tensions have long existed between Thailand and Burma, due to
                            colonialist rule that dates back to the end of World War II in 1945, and the
                            self-determination of Burma, a former British Colony. Four years after the war, in 1949, an ethnic minority,
                            the Karen Armed Forces, led a coup that resulted in direct military control of the government.
                            Over time this has led to instability along the Thailand-Burma border and has reverberated into
                            the early part of the twenty first century. This has been demonstrated by elections in 2010 that
                            were regarded by the international community as important steps toward democracy, however
                            the violent protests produced a human rights crisis. As a result of this ongoing
                            instability in Burma’s military and political systems a large portion of Burma’s population
                            has fled into Thailand for refuge. In 1988 the military seized power, democracy activists
                            disappeared and thousands fled or were forced to go into hiding. Many thousands of migrants
                            and refugees moved rapidly to the Thai-Burma border, seeking safety and protection. A steady
                            flow of refugees and migrants from Burma (renamed Myanmar as of 1989 and recognized globally in
                            2010) into Tak Province, Thailand has occurred over the last 60 years. An estimated 100 000
                            Burmese refugees entered Thailand in 2010, and have been termed ‘Internally Displaced Populations’
                            (IDPs).

                            To look at one’s self in the mirror and say “I like who I am” or “I am
                            worthwhile” and to truly mean it is not a simple task for most individuals. Yet these
                            subjective evaluations of ourselves – our self-esteem – are incredibly influential on a
                            wide range of outcomes. Past research has shown that self-esteem is related to academic
                            achievement (Marsh, 1990), happiness (Baumeister, Campbell, Krueger &amp; Vohs, 2005;
                            Taylor &amp; Brown, 1988) and psychological well-being (Kernis, 2003). These findings
                            are
                            especially significant for children, as the development of self-esteem in early
                            childhood
                            may have major implications throughout their course of life. Therefore, extensive
                            research
                            is necessary to begin applying our knowledge of self-esteem development in order to
                            examine specific parental practices and techniques that promote healthy self-esteem in
                            children across different cultures. However, previous research has been based
                            predominantly
                            on the use of explicit measures of self-esteem such as parental report or child
                            self-report
                            (Li-Hua, Li-Zhu &amp; Fang, 2006; Rosenberg &amp; Pearlin, 1978). This may be an issue
                            as
                            explicit measures of self-esteem for children are limited (Hughes, 1984) and inherently
                            susceptible to response sets such as social desirability (Nosek &amp; Greenwald, 2005).
                            As
                            well, explicit measures potentially paint an incomplete picture with respect to an
                            individual’s self-esteem; self-reports may not necessarily mirror an individual’s
                            nonconscious or implicit feelings of self-worth (Hofmann, Gawronski, Gschwendner, Le
                            &amp;
                            Schmitt, 2005). In this paper, I advocate for the use of a non-deliberative implicit
                            model
                            to help mitigate these issues when studying children’s self-esteem. I will provide
                            arguments emphasizing the need for a multifaceted approach with respect to the study and
                            application of self-esteem research in children and to determine specific factors, such
                            as
                            parental style, that encourage its positive development. Implicit measures for children
                            will be outlined to determine their validity and reliability for future research and
                            directions for future research advocating a holistic and multicul-tural approach to the
                            study of self-esteem will be discussed.
