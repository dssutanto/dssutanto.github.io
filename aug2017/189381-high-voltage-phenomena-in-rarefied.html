			<h2>Abstract</h2>
	
			<p>The present experiment aims to recreate and analyze known behavior of high-voltage gaps in a near vacuum with
				low-cost equipment. It has been previously observed that the application of high voltages in rarified gas
				results in electrical breakdown and corona discharge, characterized by the production of observable plasma
				in the experimental area. The current study aims to identify and document a do-it-yourself (DIY) method for
				producing and containing electrical discharge. Further, the requirements of electrical phenomena were
				recorded in terms of voltage and pressure to be compared to previous models, namely Paschen’s Law, as a
				measure of accuracy (Berzak et al., 2006). The operating experimental apparatus was demonstrated to exhibit
				the same discharge phenomena as previously recorded (Peek, 1929). New models for voltage and pressure
				requirements for electrical breakdown and corona discharge were produced. Literature comparison was
				available for the voltage model of electrical breakdown, where significant difference was identified between
				Paschen’s model and current data. The present study may contribute further evidence to the inadequacy of
				Paschen’s law in describing breakdown voltages at high pressure-distance configurations.</p>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
	
			<p>From antique CRT televisions to high-tech ion thrusters, electrical discharge, or a lack thereof, is critical
				for the operation of modern machinery. Precise control of electrical arcs is thus a fundamental requirement
				of present day technology, justifying further research on the topic.</p>
			<p>The current model for electrical phenomena is based upon the dielectric strength of air (Peek, 1929). At
				lower voltages, the electric field across two electrodes is sufficiently low for air to act as an insulator.
				There is no conductance and no electric arc is observed.</p>
			<p>As voltage is increased, increased dielectric flux density around the conductors forces the surrounding air
				to become conductive, forming a film of purple plasma around the active electrodes, named corona discharge
				(Peek, 1929; Goldman et al., 1985). However, the electrode gap is not yet fully conductive, so no arc is
				created.</p>
			<p>Electrical breakdown occurs when the dielectric strength of the air gap is exceeded. At this voltage, the
				neutral air molecules in the gap are ionized by the high potential difference, and the air becomes a sea of
				conductive charges (Bawagan, 1997). At this point, the circuit is completed between the two electrodes,
				resulting in a bright electrical arc.</p>
			<p>The voltage-pressure requirements for electrical discharge is predicted by Paschen’s law. Recent experimental
				evidence has both supported and disputed the accuracy of this model (Lisovskiy et al., 2000; Berzak et al.,
				2006; Massarcyzk et al., 2016). The current experiment aims to gather further experimental evidence for
				previously proposed models for electrical breakdown and to produce a novel model fit for the requirements of
				corona discharge. This study also aims to determine whether a DIY approach to the experimental apparatus is
				able to yield viable data.</p>
			<h2>Methods</h2>
	
			<h3>Measurement apparatus</h3>
			A compact fluorescent lamp (CFL) ballast was connected to a flyback transformer to convert AC into high voltage
			(HV) DC. The input of the ballast is connected to a power cord, and the output to the flyback transformer.The
			output of the flyback transformer served as one electrode, and the ground as the other. Two transformers were
			connected in parallel and plugged into a variac that controlled input AC voltage (VAC).
			The vacuum chamber was composed of glass with a 3/8” hole at one end drilled using a ceramic spade bit. A wire
			bent into a loop of diameter 5cm was inserted and the hole sealed with hot glue to prevent vacuum leaks. The
			other end of the chamber was held closed by a rubber stopper with a 1/4” hose barb. A wire was attached to the
			hose barb to act as a point of conduction.
			A vacuum pump with a connected 1/4” hose barb was used. A cross with four female NPT threads connected two hose
			barbs as well as a pressure bleed valve and a vacuum gauge.
			<h3>Corona discharge voltage measurements</h3>
			Upon reaching an absolute pressure of 11kPa, the input VAC was increased until a glow at the electrodes was
			observed. The input voltage at which this occurred was recorded. This measurement was performed with both
			electrode configurations at different electrode gap lengths.
			<h3>Breakdown voltage measurements</h3>
			Breakdown voltage was defined as the voltage at which an arc is struck between the two electrodes. A pressure of
			17kPa was obtained and the input voltage increased until a visible arc was observed. The input voltage at which
			an arc was observed was recorded. This measurement was performed with both electrode configurations at different
			electrode gap lengths.
			<h3>Breakdown pressure measurements</h3>
			Breakdown pressure was defined as the pressure at which an arc is struck between the electrodes at a maximum
			input of roughly 130VAC (4500VDC). The pressure at which a visible arc is observed was recorded. This
			measurement was performed with both electrode configurations at different electrode gap lengths.
			<h2>Results</h2>
	
			<h3>Indicators of phenomena</h3>
			<p>
				As previously indicated in literature, corona discharge was observed prior to full electrical breakdown.
				This glow persisted throughout the entire operation of the experimental apparatus. When electrical breakdown
				occurred, the observable arc extended from only one electrode. This phenomenon was consistent with previous
				experiments and featured distinct on/off behavior.
			</p>
			<h3>Equipment calibration</h3>
			<p>
				The following fit was found between DC output voltage (VDC) and AC input voltage (VAC):
			</p>
	
			<figure class="equation">
				<img src="high_voltage_eq1.PNG">
			</figure>
			<p>To obtain the aforementioned fit, DC voltage output was measured for a given AC voltage input. Unfortunately,
				a high voltage probe was not available, so a traditional multimeter was employed for the task. This
				equipment was rated for 2000VDC, and so our measurement range was confined by this upper boundary. Further,
				the transformers were found to spike in output at a certain threshold input, thus defining a lower boundary
				at approximately 1800VDC. This meant that the possible range of measurements was extremely limited, and thus
				the fit cannot be said to be very accurate.</p>
			<p>The HV power supplies were measured individually and a linear fit was extrapolated from the data. This
				individual measurement was needed as the linked power supplies produced a compounding effect that made
				measurement in the 1800-2000VDC range extremely difficult. Note that in the current configuration, the power
				supplies are linked to double amperage rather than to double voltage, so individual measurement can be
				justified.</p>
			<h3>Corona Discharge Voltage Measurements (n=100)</h3>
			<p>Corona discharge measurements were performed at an absolute pressure of 10kPa and was also observed to
				display distinct on/off behavior. The data was able to be fitted with a linear model:</p>
	
			<figure class="equation">
				<img src="high_voltage_eq2.PNG">
			</figure>
			<p>Uncertainties for the current model were also evaluated. The final values for the slope and y-intercept were
				determined to be 13951&plusmn;843 <sup>V</sup>&frasl;<sub>m</sub> and 852&plusmn;38
				<sup>V</sup>&frasl;<sub>m</sub>, respectively. Residuals and a chi-squared value of 13.3 were calculated,
				indicating a less than adequate fit between the linear model and experimental data, which was also seen in
				the slight upward trend in the residuals plot of figure 1. However, no other model was able to produce a
				lower chi-squared.</p>
			<p>The data in figure 9 show that corona voltage increases as the electrode gap distance increases. This
				increase ranges just under 2000VDC for a 0.1m increase in electrode gap distance. In figure 9, the
				calculated standard deviation was seen to be relatively small; this is supported by the fact that corona
				discharge displayed very distinguishable on/off behavior. However, the spread of the data points at similar
				electrode distances is large compared to the individual SD’s. This contributes to the high chi-squared and
				suggests that experimental data differed significantly between trials. The source of this variation could be
				linked to the DIY nature of the current experiment. A slight change in the curvature in the electrodes may
				influence the true electrode gap, thus yielding different values for corona discharge.</p>
			<figure class="figure">

				<figcaption>Fig. 1: residuals of the calculated model. Notice the lack of a clear trend and the even
					distribution of data points around the x-axis</figcaption>
			</figure>
			<h3>Breakdown voltage measurements (n=131)</h3>
			<p>Clear on/off behavior was observed, but only under certain configurations. Unfortunately, the reverse
				electrode configuration presented difficulties for the current measurement as the arc was distributed along
				the circumference of the electrode loop. It was thus difficult to distinguish between corona discharge,
				which is present at voltages lower than the breakdown voltage, and the point of breakdown. Nevertheless, a
				linear model was found with the parameters m = 20166&plusmn;1332<sup>v</sup>&frasl;<sub>m</sub> and b =
				2064&plusmn;58V:</p>
			<figure class="equation">
				<img src="high_voltage_eq3.PNG">
			</figure>
			<p>The difficulty in data collection yielded a much higher standard deviation than in corona discharge trials,
				as shown in figure 2. Consequently, chi-squared was quite low, at 0.56. Scattered residuals and the
				aforementioned chi-squared indicate that the current linear fit is adequate.</p>
			<p>Similar to corona discharge voltage, breakdown voltage appears to increase with increasing electrode
				distance. Variation between data sets is once again demonstrated to be significant. In this case, data-sets
				demonstrated similar slopes but vastly different Y-intercepts, ranging from 1000 VDC to 3000 VDC. These
				differences among experimental trials could again be attributed to the low-cost nature of the current
				project. Unaccounted extraneous variables, such as ambient humidity and temperature, could cause the
				recorded differences. Further, the output of the power supply may have fluctuated, rendering the initial VAC
				to VDC fit inaccurate.</p>

			</figure>
			<h3>Breakdown pressure measurements (n=105)</h3>
			<p>Distinct on/off behavior allowed for the precise measurement of required breakdown pressure. No difficulty in
				distinguishing breakdown pressure was noted. Once again, a linear model was shown to be fitting for the
				representation of the current data. A fit was calculated with m =
				370<sup>kPa</sup>&frasl;<sub>m</sub>&plusmn;10kPa and b = 42.1&plusmn;42.1&plusmn;0.5kPa:</p>
			<figure class="equation">
				<img src="high_voltage_eq4.PNG">
			</figure>
			<p>Residuals in figure 4 demonstrate a good model fit with points evenly dispersed across the x-axis. However, a
				chi-squared value of 66 indicates a poor fit between data and model. In this set of experiments, data from
				trials were dispersed in magnitude – no distinct separation of trials was seen as per the graph of breakdown
				voltage versus electrode gap distance. Instead, each data set fluctuated significantly around the computed
				model. This observation could be the result of the relative inaccuracy of the present system. A pressure
				release valve was manually operated to maintain a given pressure. As such, breakdown pressure could not have
				been recorded with great accuracy. However, a low standard deviation, as shown on figure 3, suggests that
				the previous notion is not true.</p>
			<p>A decreasing relationship was nevertheless observed in figure 3. As the electrode distance increased, the
				absolute pressure required for discharge decreased. Across an electrode gap difference of 0.1m, a decrease
				of up to 40kPa was observed to induce electrical breakdown. Figure 3 seems to be indicative of a logarithmic
				relationship, but a computed model did not improve the quality of the model fit. Thus, a linear relationship
				was found to be adequate.</p>

			<h2>Discussion</h2>
	
			<p>
				In the current experiment, linear fits were found for all voltage and pressure measurements. Phenomena with
				voltage as a function of electrode gap distance exhibited an increasing trend. Similarly, vacuum needed to
				sustain an arc increased with increasing gap distance, resulting in the negative correlation between
				absolute pressure and electrode gap. The obtained models are summarized as follows:

			<h3>Voltage-distance analyses</h3>
			<p>As previously mentioned, corona discharge and electrical breakdown operate by the same mechanism. The key
				difference between the two phenomena lies in the fact that the air gap between electrodes is partially
				conductive at the corona voltage and completely conductive at the breakdown voltage (Goldman et al., 1985;
				Peek, 1929).</p>
			<p>A positively correlated trend for voltage phenomena is intuitive when the current model of conduction is
				considered. At the breakdown electric field, neutral molecules in the air gap between the electrodes are
				ionized. It is hypothesized that the breakdown electric field is constant regardless of gap distance, as it
				is known that the unit dielectric strength of air is constant at a constant pressure (Peek, 1929); this
				hypothesis is in fact supported by an earlier study on this topic (Lisovskiy et al., 2000). The current
				experimental data aligns with this theory: as electrode gap increases, more potential difference is needed
				to create the same electric field. Unfortunately, the current experimental apparatus is composed of a
				conductive loop and a piece of straight wire, and thus does not behave like an ideal planeplane or
				sphere-sphere configuration, so the electric field behaves with an unknown distance dependence.</p>
			<p>The increasing trend of corona discharge can be explained by an argument similar to the one above. Although
				corona phenomena result from the ionization of air surrounding an electrode, a certain threshold electric
				field must be present to induce this conductivity.</p>
			<p>Comparison of the discharge and corona models yields an observable difference in slopes and y-intercepts. In
				both cases, the breakdown voltage model exhibits a greater value than the corona voltage plot. A t-score of
				4 was calculated between the slopes of the models and a score of 17 for the y-intercepts, suggesting that
				both parameters are statistically different.</p>
			<p>As corona discharge does not require complete conduction in air, it is presumed that less potential, and thus
				less electric field, is required to produce these effects (Goldman et al., 1985). This theory would explain
				the larger potentials needed to induce electrical breakdown, and is consistent with previous descriptions of
				corona discharge as a pre-cursor to dielectric breakdown (Peek, 1929).</p>
			<p>The difference in slopes reveal that the voltage required for electrical breakdown increases at a greater
				rate than that for corona discharge. However, previous characterization of these phenomena does not fully
				support this finding. Although a t-score of four is often enough to distinguish the difference between two
				values, the relatively low t-score could suggest that the two slope values are in tension. As such, no
				conclusive comparison can be established with current data.</p>
			<h3>Pressure-distance analysis</h3>
			<p>
				In the given model, there exists a negative correlation between pressure and gap length. Pressures above the
				breakdown pressure would contain a toohigh density of air for dielectric breakdown. Ionization of air in the
				gap would thus be not possible, and no spark was created. This is supported by the positively correlated
				linear behavior of dielectric strength with increasing absolute pressure, as established by Peek in 1929.
				So, higher absolute pressure results in higher dielectric strength, thus requiring shorter electrode
				distances for an arc to occur at the same input voltage.
			</p>
			<h3>Comparison of electrode configurations</h3>
			<p>
				The current data suggests that electrode configuration is not a factor in electrical breakdown. Average
				t-scores were calculated to be 0.54, 0.56, and 0.28 between data for the different electrode configurations.
			</p>
			<h3>Comparison to literature</h3>
			<p>The currently accepted model for electrical breakdown in a vacuum is mathematically described by Paschen’s
				law (Berzak et al., 2006; Wang, 2013; Massarczyk et al., 2016; Peek, 1929):</p>
			<figure class="equation">
				<img src="high_voltage_eq8.PNG">
			</figure>
			<p>V<sub>breakdown</sub> represents the voltage required for discharge to occur. P and d signify the pressure in
				kilopascals and electrode gap in centimeters, respectively. A and B are experimentally determined constants
				with units (kPa &times; cm)<sup>-1</sup>.</p>
			<p>Previous analyses were conducted with breakdown voltage as the y-axis and the product of pressure and
				electrode gap distance as the x-axis, as displayed in figure 5 (Al-Hakary et al., 2014; Berzak et al.,
				2006).</p>
			<p>In the present study, a linear correlation is expected as either pressure or electrode gap distance
				increases. This is because the non-linear dip in breakdown voltage seen in figure 5 is far below the
				operating conditions of the current experiment. This supports our current findings – breakdown voltage
				increases linearly with increasing electrode gap distance and increasing pressure.</p>
			<p>It must be noted that the great majority of experiments conducted to verify Paschen’s law were operated in
				much lower pressures than those used in the present study. In the experiment that produced figure 5, the
				pressures used were on the 10<sup>-1</sup>kPa magnitude (Berzak et al., 2006). The current experiment
				explored pressures in the 10<sup>1</sup>kPa magnitude. To explore whether breakdown voltage at higher
				pressures, and thus higher pressure-distance x-values, is consistent with Paschen’s law, our current model
				was plotted with other available experimental data in figure 6 and 17.</p>
			<p>From the figures, it is clear that there exists immense variation in current experimental data. Specifically,
				experiments involving low pressure-distance configurations were modeled by slopes much greater than the
				present fit. A calculated chi-squared between the Paschen’s law model and our current data yielded a value
				on the order of 10<sup>17</sup> magnitude, indicating an obvious difference between the two fits. Previous
				experiments with similar experimental conditions as the current experiment, however, were able to produce
				plots on or near the same order of magnitude as our current data, but unfortunately did not involve air as a
				conductive medium (Wang, 2013; Massarczyk et al., 2016).</p>
			<p>To create a point of reference, data for neon and air environments were taken from Berzak et al.’s 2006 study
				of Paschen’s law. In their study, low pressure-distance configurations were used, on the 10<sup>-1</sup>kPa
				magnitude as previously mentioned. The slopes of both plots lie in the same order of magnitude as a
				mathematically calculated plot of Paschen’s law, but are significantly greater than that produced by the
				current study. Wang’s 2013 simulation in neon, on the other hand, involved conditions more similar to the
				present experiment and produced a plot on the same order of magnitude as our current model. This comparison
				suggests that voltage versus pressure-distance behavior assumes a lower slope for higher pressure-distance
				values, and that Paschen’s law is inadequate for describing higher pressure-distance configurations.</p>
			<p>Given the DIY nature of the current experiment, however, this finding is not conclusive. Thus, there are two
				possible explanations for the gathered data. First, the DIY experimental apparatus and measuring techniques
				employed in the current experiment was insufficient in gathering accurate data. Second, the current
				Paschen’s model breaks down at the pressure distance values tested in the current study.</p>

			<p>In the current experiment, an experimental apparatus was built to observe and record the nature of high
				voltage phenomena in a near-vacuum. Three main classes of measurements were conducted: corona discharge
				voltage, electrical breakdown voltage, and electrical breakdown pressure. The gathered data was fitted to
				find a linear relationship between the phenomena voltage and electrode gap length:</p>

			</figure>
			<p>The absolute pressure needed for arcing to occur was found to decrease linearly with increasing electrode gap
				length:</p>
			<p>Previous experimental models were not found for corona discharge voltage and electrical breakdown pressure
				requirements. However, an established model, Paschen’s law, was available to predict the breakdown voltage
				of a given configuration as a function of pressure times distance. The current experimental model was
				compared to the mathematical model as well as available research on the topic. It was found that the current
				DIY apparatus could be insufficient in yielding viable data. However, the current findings also reveal the
				possibility that Paschen’s law is not adequate in predicting electrical breakdown voltage at higher
				pressure-distance configurations.</p>
