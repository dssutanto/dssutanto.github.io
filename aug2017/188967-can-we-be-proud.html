			<h3>Introduction</h3>
	
			<p>
				Pride emerged as a radical demonstration of the lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer (LGBTQ) civil
				rights movement. Over the years, its purpose and form have evolved. While Pride is a necessary source of
				LGBTQ representation, it often fails to observe the intersectionality within its community, resulting in
				racism, ableism, sexism, homophobia, classism, and homonormativity. This essay explores this lack of
				intersectionality, drawing on Nanaimo Pride as a source of discussion, with references to celebrations in
				Edmonton, Toronto, and New York. It concludes by offering suggestions for making Pride more inclusive.
			</p>
			<h3>Background</h3>
	
			<p>The LGBTQ civil rights movement in North America is largely attributed to the Stonewall riots, which were
				protestations of police surveillance and criminalization of LGBTQ bodies. Gay civil rights movements,
				groups, and demonstrations increased in frequency throughout North America after the Stonewall riots of
				1969, and in 1972, Canada held its first Pride celebration in Toronto. This was not representative of a more
				tolerant general population, but rather a more vocal LGBTQ community (Rau). The LGBTQ community continued to
				face legalized discrimination and persecution into the early 2000s. Police raids of lesbian and gay
				bathhouses were common, with the last major raid taking place in Toronto, 2000 (Rau). It took until July
				20th, 2004, for same-gender marriage to be legalized across Canada. It is important to note here that these
				social changes are not trailblazing initiatives, but rather echos of previous equity on this
				landscape—before the colonization of Canada, cis- and heteronormative policing was not the norm. For
				instance, many Indigenous Nations celebrated individuals with two-spirit identities, which have been
				described as Indigenous people “born with masculine and feminine spirits in one body” (Sheppard 262).
				Indigenous Nations had many ways of conceptualizing gender and sexuality that were different from European
				cultures (Sheppard 262).</p>
			<p>In 2016, the first formal Pride parade in Nanaimo, British Columbia, was held. Thousands of people showed up
				to observe the parade, and dozens of floats and walking groups participated. This was a major surprise to
				those of us participating in the parade, as Nanaimo does not have a history of being a queer-friendly city.
				The current Nanaimo Pride Society President, a Nanaimo-local gay man, says he moved away from Nanaimo in his
				youth because of the repressive atmosphere (Stern). This is something a lot of LGBTQ people who lived in
				Nanaimo in the 80s, 90s, and early 2000s have said: not only were they likely to get assaulted outside of
				Spike, the only gay bar in town, but the city council often had very bigoted people in very respected
				positions. An example of this was that “in 2000, half of Nanaimo City Council walked out of a council
				meeting after being asked to sign a Gay Pride Day Proclamation,” including the then-mayor Gary Korpan
				(Stern). The Pride Day Proclamation was consistently shut down, until the major pride association of the
				time threatened Korpan with a human rights complaint (Christopher).</p>
			<p>Given this history, the 2016 Nanaimo Pride parade meant an immense amount to many people. It didn’t spring up
				from the ground, but was the direct result of the hardworking members of the community who fought for years
				to make this event happen. Pride represented not only a moving on from a bigoted past, but also solidarity
				in the face of tragedy. Early that morning, on June 12th, the largest mass shooting in American history
				occurred at a gay bar in Orlando, Florida, with 49 people killed and 53 people injured. The Pulse nightclub
				shooting was and continues to be the largest mass shooting in American history, being so bloody that “[o]ne
				out of every three people in the club [were] wounded or killed” (Santora). This horrific hate crime sent
				ripples throughout the LGBTQ community, and its effects were felt acutely as Pride month went on. In
				Nanaimo, the Pride flag flew at half-mast. I would, then, describe the 2016 Nanaimo Pride parade as nothing
				less then necessary.</p>
			<h3>Intersectionality</h3>
	
			<p>To understand this paper, one must have an understanding of intersectionality. Intersectionality, as defined
				in Kimberle Crenshaw’s formative essay on the topic, “Traffic at the Crossroads: Multiple Oppressions,” is
				the “interactive effects of discrimination” (43). This is visualized in her essay as a traffic intersection,
				where in the roads represent the institutions of power in the world, and people with power held over them
				are trying to navigate the intersection. Crenshaw specifically wrote this paper to illuminate the
				experiences of black women, and the ways in which their gender and race interacted. The intersections with
				more roads are busier and more complicated, making them more dangerous to navigate. Crenshaw extends this
				metaphor to illustrate that the cars moving through the intersection represent the daily, seemingly
				mindless, actions that reify these power imbalances. Finally, ambulances called to these busy intersections
				have a difficult time getting there, and may in fact be too late to help. A crash or accident, in this case,
				would refer to the person navigating the intersection becoming harmed in some way. This could be a singular,
				spectacular incidence—a physical assault, or an eviction—or it could be a subtle erosion of autonomy, mental
				health, or selfworth. These micro and macro aggressions create a complex situation for people suffering from
				layered oppressions, posing a challenge for the figurative ambulances.</p>
			<p>To give an example of intersectionality, there could be a homeless young woman, who is also lesbian and First
				Nations. She would be experiencing discrimination from multiple fronts: those of her gender, her race, and
				her sexuality. Her age would place her at a disadvantage, as she wouldn’t have the full independence of an
				adult. She might experience outreach from programs centred on homeless LGBTQ youth, but they might not
				recognize the effect of the colonization of First Nations people that could play into her situation. The
				same thing could be said if she gained asylum at a women’s shelter; they could understand why she, as a
				young woman, might be in a precarious situation, but not be able to understand how her lesbianism affects
				her situation. In this way, these “ambulances” are rendered less effective to those who experience multiple
				marginalized social categories. In general, “it is difficult to talk about how one of [...] many identifiers
				may contribute to one phenomenon,” as “[i]dentities are interlocking” (Pastrana 101). In the hypothetical
				situation above, the intervention methods are failing because they are treating this person’s identities as
				“separate experiences rather than a complex and dynamic relationship” in which teasing apart the influences
				of each can be difficult or impossible (Fox 633).</p>
			<p>Pride is an ambulance, as it resulted from the need of a marginalized community to be seen and heard for one
				day a year, if nothing else. The Stonewall riots resulted directly from the fact that an intersectional
				LGBTQ community had been pushed to the boiling point, by criminalization and discrimination from every angle
				(Born). These riots helped the LGBTQ communities to gain momentum to push for further demonstrations (Born).
				When a legal or policy shift occurs, such as the decriminalization of sex between gay men, the acceptance of
				gay men and women into the military, the option for same-gender couples to adopt children, or the
				legalization of same-gender marriage, it is not the master choosing to throw a bone to a well-behaved dog.
				The bone must be taken whether the master wants it or not. It is only through the unwanted, yet continual,
				vocal push from marginalized communities that such changes are made. This is evident in my home community of
				Nanaimo, where the local government had to be petitioned and argued with — sometimes even threatened with
				legal action — for several years before a Pride day could be officially recognized. Change is not easily
				won. Pride, then, should be an event to recognize and celebrate the diversity within its community, and to
				acknowledge the members that are most vulnerable.</p>
			<h3>Homonormativity</h3>
	
			<p>
				Pride parades and events in their current forms fail to do this. While Pride started out as a series of
				riots and demonstrations, in urban areas, it is now a government- and corporate-funded, highly attended
				event. By accepting this sponsorship, Pride has become an institution, and has fallen prey to replicating
				the systems of power it is meant to expose and oppose. It is, “[i]ronically, our efforts to challenge one
				form of oppression [that] often unintentionally contribute to other forms of oppression, and our efforts to
				embrace one form of difference exclude and silence others” (Fox 631). One way Pride does this is in
				celebrating “the ideal queer person.” This person can be found centred on Pride parade posters, as the MC of
				events, and on any advertising for year-round functions. This hypothetical person is a white, able-bodied,
				upper-middle class, cisgender, neurotypical, and young gay man. There is a reason this description has
				become the poster for Pride, and it is because it appeals to straight mentality. A person like this is
				similar enough to a straight person that they can forget the “otherness” of queerness. They can comfortably
				watch shows that have this person as the token, tropic gay character, and they don’t have any problem with
				this gay man coming to their barbecue. In this way, they can be an “ally” without ever having to engage with
				the harsh realities of queer existence, or the idea that queer people might actually be different than them.
				Pride tends to indulge this idea, placing straight people’s sensibilities above the actual needs of LGBTQ
				people. When “[w]hite gay male sexualities and desires are privileged and normalized,” a concept known as
				homonormativity emerges (Greensmith 133). Homonormativity “upholds and sustains [heteronormativity] while
				promising the possibility of a demobilized gay constituency and privatized, depoliticized gay culture
				anchored in domesticity and consumption” for non-LGBTQ audiences (Greensmith 133). This homogenization of
				queer culture is one of the ways in which a faulty institution of Pride is created.
			</p>
			<h3>Racism</h3>
	
			<p>In addition to the solidification of homonormativity, Pride contradicts its own purpose of inclusivity
				through the mistreatment of racial minorities within the community. One way this manifests is in the
				presence of police at Pride. Queer people have a fraught history with the institution of police—one that
				continues today. The relationship of racial minorities with police is similarly, if not more, fraught. In
				“How a Black Lives Matter Toronto Co-Founder Sees Canada,” Janaya Khan says of her first day at Pride:
				“Having been [at Pride] for about 20 minutes I had my very first interaction with police at Pride. I have a
				history with interaction with police that hasn’t gone very well for me” (Khan). As a black person who
				identifies as “queer and as gender non-conforming,” Khan’s encounters with police were “very aggressive,”
				with the officer “demanding ID and wanting information about where [they were] going” (Khan). So, police
				have a history of being violent and discriminatory against queer people, and the same thing against people
				of colour (POC). As the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement shows us, we are also currently experiencing an
				epidemic of police brutality against black people (Wortley 53). What does it say of Pride’s priorities that
				police have their own honoured place among the festivities, often getting their own float? It speaks both to
				white supremacy and to an erasure of history. There are lovely police officers, and there are queer police
				officers. But there is no need to attend Pride in uniform, placing oneself in a position of power over the
				others attending. Read generously, this is an attempt to mend the relationship between the LGBTQ community
				and the police force. In actuality, having police at Pride does more harm then good to the POC in
				attendance.</p>
			<p>Not everyone agrees that police should not march in Pride parades, however. A news article covering the same
				issue of BLM Toronto staging a peaceful sit-in at the Toronto Pride parade—the subject of Khan’s
				aforementioned interview—says that “[a]fter being given honorary status, it was shameful of Black Lives
				Matters to disrupt the parade and for Pride for agreeing to its terms” (Jamieson). The author goes on to say
				that “[he is] proud to be a gay black man in Canada,” and that he believes that “BLM has absolutely nothing
				to do with the gay, lesbian, transgendered community” (Jamieson). This is a viewpoint lacking an
				intersectional lens. Black people are part of the LGBTQ community; the author himself is a black, gay man.
				If members of the LGBTQ community are facing extreme police brutality, for whatever reason, it should be a
				concern for the community at large. In a study focusing on the intersectionality of POC and their queer
				identities, two separate participants admitted that their identities alienated them from both the LGBTQ
				community and their racial communities. One participant says that: “Working within my racial community is a
				hindrance, as a LGBTQ-identified person [...] there is no support there,” while another says, “[s]ometimes,
				in the [gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender] GLBT community, I feel being Black may work against me
				because there is so much racism” (Pastrana 99). Clearly, there is a need for more acceptance of
				intersectionality between the LGBTQ and racial minority communities.</p>
			<p>Aside from lacking an intersectional analysis, Jamieson, the author of the critical news piece, also argues
				that Pride has been apolitical regarding non-LGBTQ issues, stating that “[h]istorically, Pride has distanced
				itself from political issues not pertaining to members of the LGBTQ community” (Jamieson). In this regard,
				Jamieson’s assertion is incorrect. Firstly, if someone is queer, then that makes the other aspects of their
				identity important to LGBTQ activism. To assert the opposite seems unnecessarily divisive. Secondly, some of
				the most important figures in LGBTQ civil rights history were people of colour who fought for the rights of
				coloured queer people, such as Marsha P. Johnson. Pride is not a hobby: it is explicitly political in
				nature.</p>
			<h3>Ableism</h3>
	
			<p>
				As well as failing to understand the intersection of race, sexual orientation, and gender identity, Pride
				fails its members who are disabled. This happens both at Pride, a once-a-year event, and in the general
				community events which happen year-round. An example of ableism in Pride was at the 2011 Edmonton pride
				parade. An article covering this topic says this: “Edmonton Pride’s official slogan this year is ‘STAND UP.’
				Although dismayed by the ableist language, we were hoping, at the very least that this slogan signalled a
				move towards a more political Pride” (Peers). The slogan, in fact, asked readers to “STAND UP” and dance, or
				to “STAND UP” and barbecue—far from overtly political activities. This erasure of disabled bodies is not
				unusual in Edmonton, or Canada at large. In most queer campaigning there “is the noticeable lack of fat,
				gender-queer, wheeling, scootering, ageing, small-statured, cane-wielding, pre-pubescent and dog-guided
				members of our queer communities” (Peers). When summer rolls around, “the Edmonton Pride Festival society
				rents one of the most accessible venues in Edmonton, and, through great expense and logistical prowess,
				manages to transform it into an almost entirely inaccessible space” (Peers). Most yearround events aren’t
				any better: being held at the top of stairs, neglecting to accommodate walking assistance devices, and
				remaining unsuitable for people with non-normative hearing or sight (Peers). Another obvious example of this
				is that Pride parades themselves reinforce the ableist assumption that participants can walk: freely,
				easily, and without pain. All of this is indicative of an atmosphere within queer communities that doesn’t
				include people with disabilities. Even if there is no explicit sign—like a staircase—disabled people often
				feel excluded from the community at large. As stated earlier in this essay, “the ideal queer person” is
				able-bodied, to better appeal to the nonLGBTQ Canadian audience. The LGBTQ community itself has absorbed
				this attitude.
			</p>
			<h3>Sexism</h3>
	
			<p>
				While the face of Pride is not one of the disabled body, the same can be said of women. This fact finds its
				origins in misogyny, of which Pride is not exempt. This cultural maligning of women reveals itself in Pride
				celebrating men’s sexuality over women’s sexuality. Women’s sexuality is often a source of anxiety in our
				culture—it is dark, unknowable, and utterly other (Creed 1). If this is so for women’s heterosexuality, it
				can only be doubly so for lesbianism or other sapphic orientations. This anxiety often manifests as an
				outright denial of queer female sexualities (Lamble 81). In Canadian history, sexually active gay men were
				perceived as defiant and immoral, and so the act was criminalized. In contrast, sex between women was almost
				never directly, legally addressed (Rau). In Canadian history and in the present, “lesbians appear as
				disembodied, desexualized legal subjects” (Lamble 81). An example of this in the modern world is the fact
				that the age of consent for oral or vaginal intercourse is 16, while the age of consent for anal intercourse
				is 18 (Rau). Currently, men and women who engage in same-gender sex face different levels of
				criminalization. This clearly shows the different ways in which queer sexualities are discriminated against
				based on gender. Gender and sexuality are extremely close concepts in patriarchal Canadian culture, where a
				seemingly intrinsic part of being a woman is desiring men. Therefore, lesbianism is an act of subverting
				female gender roles in patriarchal culture. Deeply rooted cultural anxiety over female sexuality in Canadian
				society, combined with patriarchal expectations for female desire, culminate in the fact that male
				sexuality, even when it entitles men’s attraction to other men, is often more palatable in our society than
				non-heterosexual female sexuality. This purposeful invisibility of female queer sexuality is a sign of
				Pride’s homonormativity.
			</p>
			<h3>Classism</h3>
	
			<p>
				Having discussed race, gender, and ability, the final way I will discuss the shortcomings of Pride and the
				LGBTQ community is in relation to class. Pride should accommodate those that do not have the financial means
				to live a comfortable economic existence. Examining Pride through a class lens is particularly important
				because of the correlation between LGBTQ youth and homelessness—LGBTQ youth are more likely to be homeless
				than almost any other demographic (Kirkup). In Canada there are startlingly few studies done to survey the
				amount of homeless youth who are LGBTQ, but some researchers say that around 40-50% of homeless youth are
				LGBTQ (Kirkup). Another study finds that 1 in 5 Toronto homeless youths identified as LGBTQ (“Facts &amp;
				States”). This is extremely disproportionate. According to Statistics Canada, only 1-1.7% of the Canadian
				population identifies as LGBTQ (“Same-sex couples”). These statistics would only reflect the amount of LGBTQ
				people who were “out.” Even so, the number of homeless LGBTQ youths far outpaces the relative size of the
				national community. Pride does not factor this into event planning most of the time. Pride parades can be
				expensive affairs: from surcharges for simple attendance, expensive food vendors and merchandise, and
				travelling fees. I have struggled with this myself. Before Nanaimo overcame the discrimination in the city
				council and general population to have its first Pride parade, the only nearby major Pride event was held in
				Vancouver. I would have to pay for the ferry, food, and accommodations. This was expensive enough that I was
				never able to attend, so my first Pride was the one held in Nanaimo. One of the biggest offences related to
				pay-to-play culture is the Stonewall Pride march, which has been described as “a commercial extravaganza of
				huge proportions” (Clare). The 25th anniversary of the Stonewall riots struck many as “not so much as a
				celebration of a powerful and life-changing uprising of queer people, led by trans people of color, by drag
				queens and butch dykes, fed up with the cops, but as a middle- and upper-class urban party that opened its
				doors only to those who could afford it” (Clare). I’m sure it’s very fun for those who can afford to go. It
				seems unfair, however, to limit one’s engagement in queer culture based on monetary wealth, when LGBTQ
				youth, women, people of colour, and disabled people face significant financial barriers to participation.
			</p>
			<h3>How to be proud of pride</h3>
	
			<p>Having identified a number of barriers to truly inclusive Pride events, I now turn to how we might make them
				more welcoming to everyone in the LGBTQ community. While making Canadian Pride completely inclusive of all
				its members would require making the wider Canadian culture free of prejudice, this is an undertaking too
				large for the scope of this essay. Instead, I will focus on more achievable goals. When it comes to racism
				in Pride, excluding police and honouring groups such as BLM is a straightforward step. It is also important
				to actually listen to marginalized groups when they say something is not right, or if they have suggestions
				for improvements to Pride: they know more about what they need than people who do not share their lived
				experiences.</p>
			<p>A way to combat ableism in Pride is to be aware of whether the venues one attends are disability-friendly or
				not. If they aren’t, bring attention to this fact and make a fuss about it, or join the organizing committee
				and make sure future venues are accessible. The only way for change to happen is to push for it. Again,
				listening to disabled LGBTQ communities is the best way to know how to move forward.</p>
			<p>Misogyny can be incredibly insidious. When it comes to queer women, increased visibility would go a long way
				towards combating the combined effects of sexism and heterosexism. I would love to see more women’s events
				in my own community, and a greater platform for women’s groups at Pride. A shift of this kind would help
				Pride to be more inclusive of the queer women who attend.</p>
			<p>As for classism, one shouldn’t need to be rich to go to Pride. Surcharges for events such as Stonewall 25
				should be done-away with. While I can see the need for some venues to charge for attendance if they do not
				otherwise have enough funds to continue offering them, a pay-as-much-as-you-can system would be incredibly
				beneficial. When it comes to Pride, a greater platform should be given to the homelessness epidemic the
				youth of the LGBTQ communities are facing. As well, more small towns and cities should have Pride events, so
				that people don’t feel pressured to travel simply to engage in their own culture.</p>
			<p>Pride has the potential to be an amazing source of affirmation in your own identity and community, as well as
				a platform for activism. However, aspects of racism, ableism, sexism, heterosexism, classism, as well as
				homonormativity have gained a foothold in the festivities. It is by continuing the dialogue of
				intersectionality within LGBTQ communities and allowing marginalized identities to have voice in these
				proceedings that prejudice within LGBTQ communities and the events of Pride can be combated. Only then, can
				we be proud of Pride.</p>
